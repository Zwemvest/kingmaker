# Shorter Adventure Summary
# Before start
The nation of [[Brevoy]] is teetering on civil war. The [[Aldori-Swordlords|Aldori Swordlords]] have picked the side of Lord Surtova, but for now wish to avoid getting directly involved. 

Instead, they've convinced Surtova to settle a nation of adventurers as allies, in a region south of [[Brevoy]]; the [[../Places/River-Kingdoms/Stolen-Lands.md|Stolen Lands]]. [[Brevoy]] has claimed this region, but never exerted strong control over it. An ally in that region would make Surtova's position a lot stronger, diplomatically, militarily, and politically. 

The [[../Places/River-Kingdoms/Stolen-Lands.md|Stolen Lands]] are a dangerous region, full of [[../Creatures/Organizations/Bandits.md]], where [[../Creatures/Monsters/Fey.md]] presence seems to be stronger than usual. Nobody in history has ever held the [[../Places/River-Kingdoms/Stolen-Lands.md|Stolen Lands]] as a kingdom for long. Since neither the [[../Creatures/Organizations/Aldori-Swordlords.md|Swordlords]] nor Surtova can spare any troops, adventurers will have to settle the dangerous region. Guess who those adventurers are?
