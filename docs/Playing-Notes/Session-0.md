A decade has passed since the mysterious disappearance of House Rogarvia and its heirs, plunging [[Brevoy]] into turmoil. With the once dominant rulers gone, the fragile peace of the region has crumbled, teetering on the brink of civil war. House Surtova of [[Issia]] has seized power, establishing themselves as the de facto rulers of [[Brevoy]] through cunning alliances and covert schemes.

Meanwhile, the [[Aldori-Swordlords|Swordlords]] of the Free City of [[Restov]], situated along the [[Shrike-River|Shrike River]] in southeastern [[Brevoy]], have steadfastly refused King-Regent [[Noleski-Surtova|Noleski Surtova]]'s attempts to conscript them into his rule. In response, Surtova's loyalists, disguised as Aldori apprentices, have sought to steal the [[Aldori-Swordlords|Swordlords]]' martial techniques, escalating tensions and fueling rumors of impending conflict.

Despite internal strife, [[Noleski-Surtova|King Surtova]] has been persuaded by [[Restov]]'s Lord Mayor [[Ioseph-Sellemius|Ioseph Sellemius]] to address external threats posed by the chaotic [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]] to the south. Seeking to stabilize the region, a call for adventurers has been issued to settle the untamed [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]], an area notorious for its lawlessness and danger.

Our tale begins with the party responding to this call to adventure, responding to a call from [[Jamandi-Aldori|Lady Aldori]] for brave adventurers.
## 24 Calistril 4710
Upon our arrival at [[Jamandi-Aldori|Lady Jamandi]]'s magnificent hilltop manor, we were greeted by a beautiful sight. The spacious hall had been meticulously arranged for a splendid feast, guarded by vigilant heavily armed soldiers. A roaring fire emanated warmth from a colossal fireplace, its iron lever secured by a lock, adding to the hall's decor. Ornate chandeliers adorned the ceiling, casting a soft glow over the exquisite artwork gracing the walls. Tables at the room's center were laden with silverware, surrounded by the aroma of roasted meats and other delectable dishes.

Seated amongst us were two companions: [[Amiri]], a formidable [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords|Kellid]] Barbarian, and [[Tartuccio]], a witty [[gnome]] wizard. As conversation flowed, [[Amiri]] voiced her anticipation for [[Jamandi-Aldori|Lady Jamandi]]'s presence, while [[Tartuccio]] couldn't resist continued snide jabs at [[Amiri]]'s perceived lack of manners, eyeing us to see if we'd agree. Meanwhile, [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] indulged in a drink from the pitcher, adding to the lively atmosphere of the gathering.

As [[Ioseph-Sellemius|Ioseph Sellemius]] and the graceful Lady [[Jamandi-Aldori|Jamandi Aldori]] entered the hall, an air of importance accompanied them. [[Jamandi-Aldori|Lady Jamandi]], with her striking half-[[Elf|elven]] beauty, commanded attention as she joined the gathering. Ioseph took the opportunity to introduce her, elaborating on her significance and the pressing need for adventurers in their endeavors, in name of the [[Aldori-Swordlords|Aldori Swordlords]].

[[Jamandi-Aldori|Lady Aldori]] spoke of the perilous nature of the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]] - a realm plagued by monsters and [[bandits]], its rulership constantly in flux. Undeterred by the challenges, she extended an invitation for bold souls to claim these lands, promising recognition from [[Rostland]] for those who succeeded. With a determined gesture, she raised her gauntlet, symbolizing her resolve.

Amidst the preparations for the feast, conversations veered towards various topics. [[Kairos]] delved into the intricate politics of [[Brevoy]], while [[Djames]] recounted legends surrounding the Aldori lineage, emphasizing the Aldori wealth and prowess. [[Djames]] also shared insights into [[Jamandi-Aldori|Lady Aldori]]'s background specifically, detailing her history as a mercenary and how she has now retired to her mansion, focused on her status and estate.

[[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] approached [[Linzi]] with curiosity, remarking on her petite stature in her typically candid manner. Engaging in what could be considered polite conversation by [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]]'s standards, she inquired about [[Linzi]]'s musical talents and instruments. [[Linzi]], eager to share, began weaving a captivating tale of heroism and adventure through her music.

However, as [[Linzi]]'s story grew lengthy, [[Kairos]] interjected, shifting the conversation towards the bard's attire, a clear indicator of her profession. This redirection led to a discussion about Pitax, its political landscape, and the challenges faced by artists under its rule.

Meanwhile, [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]]'s playful antics with her gold bead and [[Gomi]], her trusty companion, left a lasting impression on [[Linzi]]. The bard was charmed by [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]]'s demeanor and delighted in the attention given to her beloved pet. Before long, [[Gomi]] was receiving affectionate pets from [[Linzi]], further cementing the bond between the two groups.

[[Leonardo-Lebeda|Leonardo]]'s attempt at flirtation with [[Valerie]] fell flat, met with polite but distant responses from her. Despite this, [[Valerie]] eagerly engaged in political discourse, displaying a keen interest in such matters. She recognized [[Leonardo-Lebeda|Leonardo]] from their shared circles in [[Brevoy]]'s noble society, leading to a discussion about their backgrounds and connections.

Turning his attention to [[Harrim]], [[Leonardo-Lebeda|Leonardo]] adopted a more imposing demeanor. [[Harrim]], a [[dwarf]] with a weathered appearance, spoke openly about his pursuit of death during their conversation. As a cleric of [[Groetus]], he viewed death as an inevitable part of existence, discussing its significance and implications for prophecy. Despite [[Leonardo-Lebeda|Leonardo]]'s jest about hastening [[Harrim]]'s demise, the [[dwarf]] remained steadfast in his beliefs, emphasizing the acceptance of mortality.

Meanwhile, [[Djames]] conversed with [[Maegar-Varn|Maegar Varn]], focusing on local politics. [[Djames]] observed the crest adorning Varn's attire, recognizing it as the emblem of House Varn. Inquiring about its significance, Maegar revealed his familial ties to the house, although his interest in the conversation waned over time, indicating a lack of enthusiasm for further discussion.

After encountering a lukewarm reception from [[Maegar-Varn|Maegar Varn]], [[Djames]] redirected his attention to [[Linzi]], who greeted him warmly, citing [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]]'s praise of him. [[Djames]] shared a tale of nature's resilience and the bonds the party has already forged, offering insights into his philosophy on settling the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]]. Intrigued, [[Linzi]] inquired about his favorite performers, revealing her admiration for a performer group called "The Walking Tears". [[Djames]] reciprocated with his preference for the performer group "Securius", captivating [[Linzi]] with their shared love for storytelling. As a gesture of appreciation, [[Linzi]] presented [[Djames]] with a Jade Cat and an Onyx Panther as parting gifts.

Meanwhile, [[Kairos]] attempted to engage [[Jaethal]] in conversation, noting her aloof demeanor. Despite [[Kairos]]'s efforts, [[Jaethal]] remained focused on her food, signalling a lack of interest. Similarly, [[Kairos]]'s interaction with [[Harrim]] centered on polite conversation, with [[Kairos]] unable to decipher the religious symbolism adorning [[Harrim]]'s attire.

Elsewhere, [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] struck up a conversation with [[Amiri]], admiring her appearance and learning about the origins of her sword and the losses suffered by her clan. As their discussion turned to drinking and revelry, [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]], [[Amiri]], and [[Djames]] bonded over shared experiences, quickly forming a camaraderie as drinking buddies. However, [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]]'s tolerance for alcohol appeared limited, evident in her slightly impaired state.

[[Kairos]] engaged [[Valerie]] in conversation, probing into her motivations for joining the expedition. However, [[Valerie]] remained guarded, offering only vague sentiments about seeking a fresh start, opting to keep the discussion at a superficial level.

Meanwhile, [[Djames]] recognized the [[Iron-Wraiths|Iron Wraiths]], an adventuring party clad in full plate armor even during festivities. Notably, he also identified [[Hannis-Drelev|Hannis Drelev]] among the attendees, adding an air of familiarity to the gathering.

As the evening progressed, [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]]'s inebriation became more apparent, leading her to ramble to [[Amiri]] as tiny liquor bubbles seemingly emanated from her. Sensing [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]]'s increasing intoxication, [[Djames]] intervened while [[Kairos]] questioned [[Amiri]] about her knowledge of the Broken Tusk tribes, to which [[Amiri]] admitted unfamiliarity. [[Leonardo-Lebeda|Leonardo]], curious about [[Amiri]]'s sword, conversed with her in Hallit, while [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] continued to distribute alcohol to the party. Grateful for the lively stories shared, [[Amiri]] expressed her appreciation by offering [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] a +1 Dagger.

Meanwhile, outside, the storm intensified, its relentless downpour punctuated by the tolling of a bell. [[Jamandi-Aldori|Lady Jamandi]] seized the moment to address the gathering, encouraging everyone to enjoy the food and drink before retiring early. With cheers from the revelers echoing through the hall, [[Jamandi-Aldori|Lady Jamandi]] hinted at forthcoming discussions regarding each adventuring party's specific missions and directives in the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]].

## 25 Calistril 4710
We retired to our quarters around 9 in the evening, seeking sleep, though [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]], true to her nature, remained in more of a plant-like hibernation. However, our slumber was abruptly interrupted at 3 in the morning by a hounding cry echoing through the halls. Despite the disturbance, [[Djames]] remained sound asleep until [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] roused him from his slumber. Quickly realizing the urgency of the situation, we sprang into action, hastily donning our armor while [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] directed [[Gomi]] to cautiously scout the corridors.

[[Gomi]]'s reconnaissance revealed the presence of dark figures lurking nearby. Acting swiftly, [[Kairos]] pressed herself against the wall, blending into the shadows as she cautiously opened the door. Sensing imminent danger, the party prepared to ambush the attackers, bracing for the impending confrontation.

As the assailants breached the threshold, [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] unleashed a volley from her sling, narrowly missing her target. Simultaneously, a second attacker targeted [[Leonardo-Lebeda|Leonardo]] with a ranged assault before retreating to reload. Seizing the opportunity, [[Kairos]] emerged from the doorway, wielding her [[Elf|Elven]] Glaive with deadly precision in a spellstrike. Meanwhile, [[Djames]] employed his magic, casting Daze to incapacitate the second assailant.

With the situation escalating, [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] commanded [[Gomi]] to unleash a powerful Electric Arc attack, incapacitating both the second guard and a third attacker. In the chaos that ensued, [[Leonardo-Lebeda|Leonardo]] delivered a decisive blow, dispatching the final assailant and neutralizing the immediate threat.

As the sounds of conflict echoed through the castle corridors, a heavy thud reverberated, signaling the closure of the gates and the implementation of a lockdown. [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] approached the fallen guard in an attempt to assess his condition, but it was clear he had succumbed to his injuries. Meanwhile, [[Leonardo-Lebeda|Leonardo]] wasted no time in preparing himself, donning his cumbersome armor in anticipation of further confrontations.

With a cautious approach, we divided into smaller groups to investigate different rooms, searching for any surviving occupants. [[Kairos]]'s initial inspection revealed a room devoid of life but marked by blood-soaked bedding and a grim discovery of a severed hand. In another room, [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]], accompanied by [[Gomi]] and [[Djames]], stumbled upon several corpses alongside a gleaming object, while a separate chamber yielded a minor healing potion, promptly claimed by [[Kairos]].

Despite the absence of inhabitants in the final room [[Kairos]] inspected, the disheveled bedding hinted at recent occupation. Conversely, the chamber examined by [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]], [[Gomi]], and [[Djames]] revealed a similarly desolate scene, with bloodstained beds serving as the only remnants of previous occupants. With [[Leonardo-Lebeda|Leonardo]] now fully armored, we proceeded to the indoor gardens, where we were met by four hostile assailants lying in wait.

[[Kairos]] wasted no time in engaging the attackers, swiftly dispatching the first with a decisive blow. However, her subsequent attempt was met with less success as the second attacker narrowly evaded her strike, opting instead to target [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] with a ranged assault, fortunately missing its mark.

After the skirmish intensified, [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] swiftly conjured a protective barrier using her Interposing Earth ability, seeking cover from the assailants' onslaught. In a display of formidable prowess, [[Leonardo-Lebeda|Leonardo]], fueled by bloodlust, advanced towards a third attacker, delivering a devastating blow with his greatsword that sent the assailant reeling.

Undeterred, the remaining adversaries pressed their assault. One assailant hurled a mysterious bottle of white liquid at [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]]'s barricade, striking both her and [[Djames]], while another fired a crossbow at [[Gomi]]. In response, [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] unleashed her Wilding Word, directed at the assailant who targeted [[Gomi]], while [[Djames]] rallied the party with a resounding Courageous Anthem before incapacitating the second assailant with his Daze spell.

Meanwhile, [[Kairos]] tapped into her arcane abilities, unleashing a Dimensional Assault attack that swiftly dispatched the final enemy. As a precaution, she fortified herself with a Shield cantrip. Despite the enemy's futile attempts to retaliate with crossbow fire, [[Kairos]] remained unscathed, save for a minor splash damage, while [[Leonardo-Lebeda|Leonardo]] swiftly dispatched the last foe in a decisive counterattack.

While exploring the area, [[Djames]]'s keen eye catches sight of an intriguing statue. Crafted from marble, it depicts a life-sized [[half-elf]] woman wielding a rose and a shield. Despite [[Djames]] and [[Kairos]] being unable to identify its significance, [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] astutely notices a small door concealed beneath the statue's base. Waste no time, [[Djames]] unlocks the door with a bronze key, revealing a cache of valuable items:
- 4 Minor healing potions
- Barkskin potion
- Lesser potion of fire resistance

[[Kairos]] goes back to loot the corpses of the enemies, and to find the silver ring left out earlier. She also finds a longsword, which she gives to [[Leonardo-Lebeda|Leonardo]]. 

When the party continues, a deep and dull roar sounds through the rooms. [[Gomi]] checks the room where the sound came from, and flies back when [[Gomi]] knows it has seen a monster. There's a small person in the room, someone who [[Gomi]] knows has recently pet [[Gomi]]. We carefully check inside and see a giant.

[[Leonardo-Lebeda|Leonardo]] and [[Kairos]] ready Runic Weapon, and [[Kairos]] enters Arcane Cascade. [[Djames]] is up first, and uses Courageous Anthem to inspire all party members. He then casts Forbidden Ward om [[Djames]] and the giant inside. [[Kairos]] ran inside, and used a Spellstrike attack with her Runic Weapon spell and Gouging Claw. The ogre is clearly blinded and starts scratching himself furiously, and [[Gomi]] finishes the giant with an attack. 

We take an Ogre-hook and his lice invested furs. [[Linzi]] is glad about being rescued and hands a Scroll of Inkshot to [[Gomi]] and [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]]. [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] also guides us into a secret room with a trunk, where [[Djames]] hands us bronze key and the party opens it. The trunk contains 8 bags with 100 gold each, a +1 mace, a+1 longsword, 2 lesser healing potions, and a small leatherbound journal.

We also explore some of the servents quarters, and what is clearly a storeroom, but move on as soon as we can. We soon enter a mesh hall with a battered and beaten giant, which [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] immediately recognizes as a Frost Giant, after [[Amiri]]'s description. We contemplate his wounds, and [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] slowly approaches him to cast an AoE Heal spell on him and heals his wounds. 

We hear some soft moans as the Heal spell takes effect, and immediately [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] notices [[Harrim]], [[Valerie]], and [[Amiri]]. [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] talks with the Frost Giant and convinces it to let us pass in a friendly manner. They ask about the Frost Giant, and [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] argues it's a big friend now. [[Kairos]] remembers everything about Frost [[Giants]], including how hostile and evil they can be. Even though the giant isn't attacking, there's a lot of hostile air, and [[Amiri]] and [[Valerie]] in particular consider attacking the giant. 

[[Kairos]] argues that we can't break a certain deal, as it would violate the second [[River-Freedoms|River Freedom]]. [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] tries a last attempt at letting us pass, and convinces the giant to let us pass and leave the castle. [[Valerie]] isn't happy, but accepts our answer, while [[Amiri]] is extremely mad about our choice.

Pressing forward, we thoroughly search the remaining rooms, uncovering a trove of gold, weapons, armor, and a Tanglefoot Bag. After calming [[Amiri]]'s anger, we proceed to the great hall, prepared to continue our journey.
