## 24 Calistril 4710
We arrive at Lady Jamandi's impressive hilltop manor. The spaceous hall has been prepared for a great feast, while heavily armed soldiers watch over the hall. A fire crackles in a large fireplace. An iron lever, secured by a lock, adores the fireplace. Massive chandeliers hang from the ceiling, and beautiful artwork is seen all over the walls. Tables are placed in the center in the room, covered with cutlery, while the scent of delicious roasted meat and other delicious foods fills the room.

We are seated with two others, a Kellid Barbarian named Amiri, and a gnome wizard, named Tartuccio. Lizzy drinks from the pitcher.  Amiri makes conversation about how she expected lady Jamandi to be here already. Tartuccio remarks on the rude manners of Amiri

Ioseph Sellemius and Lady Jamandi Aldori walk in. She's a beautiful half-elf. Ioseph explains who Lady Jamandi is, and why they need adventurers. Lady Aldori tells more about the Stolen Lands, and how it's a haven for monsters and bandits, and nobody has held the lands for long. She now invites people to take the Stolen Lands, and promises Rostland will recognize the new barons or baronesses of the Stolen Lands. She raises her gauntlet. 

Several servants are placing foods on the tables. Kairos talks about the politics of Brevoy, while Djames mentiones the legends around the Aldori, like their wealth and how her swords can spew fire. Djames also mentions her history as a mercenary, and how Lady Aldori has now retired to her mansion, mostly focussed on maintaining her position and her villa. 

Lizzy walks up to Linzy and asks why she is so small. She makes a little bit of polite (in Lizzy's terms) conversation with Linzy. Lizzy asks Linzy about her music and her instruments. Linzy starts a interesting and heroic story, but Kairos jumps into the conversation when the story becomes long-winded by asking Linzy about her clothes (which clearly indicate her as a bard). Linzy and Kairos talk about Pitax, the political situation in Pitax, and the presecutation of the arts.

Lizzy makes an impression on the table with Linzy by toying around with her gold bead. Linzy is heavily impressed. Lizzy also plays around with Gomi, which Linzy absolutely adores. Linzy shortly pets Gomi. 

Leonardo talks to Valerie. Leonardo attempts an awkward form of flirting, but Valerie doesn't really engage with him. She mentions she's here for the first time. She does engage on the more political talk, seemingly enjoying the conversation with Valerie. Valerie talks more about how she recognizes Leonardo from the Brevoy noble circles, and mentions how she's from the same circles. Leonardo talks more about where he's from, and his history. 

Leonardo later turns to the dwarf on the table, switching from a more elegant disposition to a more intimidating one. Harrim is a dwarf with a salt-and-pepper beard, talking about how he seeks death in any form on his adventure, not caring if it's other adventurers or himself. Harrim is a cleric of Groetus, talking more about how he seeks death in honest ways, not to end his life prematurely, despite Leonardo asking him if he'd like to die today. Harrim mostly talks about the end of all hope, how we must all look forward to death, and what death means for prophecy. 

Djames talks with Maegar Varn, mostly about local politics. Djames pays special attention to the clothes of Varn, noticing a crest with four hatches, the weapon of House Varn. Djames asks about it, and Maeger mentions how his father is the ruler of House Varn. Djames tries a short conversation with Maeger, but it becomes clearer and clearer that Maeger is fairly uninterested. 

After Djames is rebuffed, he moves on to Linzy to introduce himself, and Linzy mentions about how much glowingly Lizzy has spoken about Djames. Djames tells a story to Linzy about nature, regrowth, how adventurers are brought together by regrowth, and Djames' philosophy on settling the Stolen Lands. Linzy herself asks about Djames' favorite performers, her own being The Walking Tears. Djames says his favorite is Securius. Linzy is absolutley captivated by the stories of Djames and Lizzy, and offers a Jade Cat and an Onyx Panther as a parting gift. 

Kairos talks a little with Jaethal. She notices that Jaethal is a pale and sober elf, but the more she tries to make conservation with Jaethal, the more Jaethal turns away to focus on her food. Kairos also tries to talk a bit to Harrim, but can't place his religious icons. With Harrim too, the conversation is mostly limited to polite conversation.

Lizzy walks up to Arimi to talk to her about how cool she looks, and Amiri mentions how she got her sword, where it came from, and the losses of her clan. Amiri and Djames make more conversation about drinking and partying as Amiri, Djames, and Lizzy start to become better friends (and drinking buddies). Lizzy, too, drinks, but seems to handle the alcohol not too well. 

Kairos joins Valerie to talk about why she wishes to join the expedition. Valerie mostly talks in very general terms about looking for a new start, and stays fairly surface level. 

Djames recognizes the adventure party of the Iron Wraiths, an adventure party that is still in full plate even while partying. They have their own party. He also recognizes Hannis Drelev.

Lizzy gets drunker and drunker and starts rambling to Amiri as small liquor bubbles pop from her bodies. Djames starts stopping the drunk Lizzy as Kairos asks Amiri if she ever heard of the Broken Tusk tribes. Amiri isn't exactly familiair with them. Leonardo asks more about Amiri and her sword, in Hallit. Lizzy starts handing out more glasses of booze to the party. Amiri thanks Lizzy and Djames for the wild stories. She offers a +1 Dagger to Lizzy. 

In the meantime, the storm has increased in intensity, raining harder and harder, when a bell sounds. Lady Jamandi starts a large speech about enjoying the food and drink. Several dozens mugs and goblets sound cheering before the room calms down again. Jamadi suggests everyone gets an early rest, before she'll talk individually to different adventuring parties about their exact missions and directives into the Stolen Lands. 

## 25 Calistril 4710
We retire to our quarters around 9 to fall asleep (except Lizzy, who doesn't sleep). We are waken up at 3 by a hounding yell sounding through the halls, except Djames, who stays sound asleep until Lizzy wakes him up. We get up out of bed, don our armor, and Lizzy has Gomi carefully scout the halls.

Gomi sees some dark-colored people. Kairos pushes herself against the wall to hide/take cover, and carefully opens the door. The party gets ready to ambush the attackers. The yell came from a guard, ambushed by three attackers.

A first attacker enters, and Lizzy shouts with her sling, but misses. A second attacker shoots Leonardo, reloads, and moves away. Kairos steps out the door, and uses her Elven Glaive to make a spellstrike. Djames casts Daze on the second guard that tried to shoot Leonardo. Lizzy asks Gomi to make an Electric Arc attack, and shocks the second guard, plus a third attacker, and kills it. Leonardo kills the final attacker. 

We hear more fights in the corridors of the castle. A loud, dull thump sounds, of the gates closing and the building going on lockdown. Lizzy walks up to the dead guard, and tries to check if he's okay. He's not. Leonardo starts to don his heavy armor. 

We carefully split up, and check several different rooms to see if the occupants are still alive. The first room that Kairos checks, contains no corpses, but blood-drenched beds and a single severed hand. The room that Lizzy, Gomi, and Djames check, contains a few corpses and a shiny item. The second room contains another few corpses, but also a minor healing potion. Kairos takes it. The final room Kairos checks is empty, though the beds seem slept in. There is no equipment either.

The final room, checked by Lizzy, Gomi, and Djames, is again empty but with beds drenched in blood. Leonardo walks out of the room, having finally donned his armor. We move into the indoor gardens, where four attackers await us, and Kairos immediately assaults the first attacker, killing it. A second attacker Kairos, but misses, reloads, shoots Lizzy, and misses again.

Lizzy summons a barrier to hide behind after the attack with her Interposing Earth ability. Leonardo strides to a third attacker, bloodlust in his eyes, and makes a powerful strike against the third attacker. With a powerful greatsword atack, he slams the attacker away. 

The remaining two attackers attack. The first throws an unknown bottle of white liquid against Lizzy's wall, hitting Lizzy and Djames, the second fires a crossbow at Gomi. Lizzy yells out her WIlding Word to the attacker who tried to shoot Gomi. Djames yells out his notes, a Courageous Anthem, and then uses his Daze against the second still living enemy. 

Kairos enters Arcane Cascade, attacks with a Dimensional Assault attack and kills the last enemy. Finally, she uses her Shield cantrip. The final enemy, seeing his friend die, attacks with a crossbow twice, but misses both times. Kairos does take 1 splash damage. Leonardo kills him in retaliation.

Djames notices a statue. It's an fairly interesting, life sized marble statue decepting a half-elf woman with a rose and a shield. Though neither Djames nor Kairos recognizes the statue, Lizzy quickly discovers a small door underneath the statue, and Djames opens the door to take multiple potions, and a bronze key: 
- 4 Minor healing potions
 - Barkskin
 - Lesser potion of fire resistance

Kairos goes back to loot the corpses of the enemies, and to find the silver ring left out earlier. She also finds a longsword, which she gives to Leonardo. 

When the party continues, a deep and dull roar sounds through the rooms. Gomi checks the room where the sound came from, and flies back when Gomi knows it has seen a monster. There's a small person in the room, someone who Gomi knows has recently pet Gomi. We carefully check inside and see a giant.

Leonardo and Kairos ready Runic Weapon, and Kairos enters Arcane Cascade. Djames is up first, and uses Courageous Anthem to inspire all party members. He then casts Forbidden Ward om Djames and the giant inside. Kairos ran inside, and used a Spellstrike attack with her Runic Weapon spell and Gouging Claw. The ogre is clearly blinded and starts scratching himself furiously, and Gomi finishes the giant with an attack. 

We take an Ogre-hook and his lice invested furs. Linzy is glad about being rescued and hands a Scroll of Inkshot to Gomi and Lizzy. Lizzy also guides us into a secret room with a trunk, where Djames hands us bronze key and the party opens it. The trunk contains 8 bags with 100 gold each, a +1 mace, a+1 longsword, 2 lesser healing potions, and a small leatherbound journal.

We also explore some of the servents quarters, and what is clearly a storeroom, but move on as soon as we can. We soon enter a mesh hall with a battered and beaten giant, which Lizzy immediately recognizes as a Frost Giant, after Amiri's description. We contemplate his wounds, and Lizzy slowly approaches him to cast an AoE Heal spell on him and heals his wounds. 

We hear some soft moans as the Heal spell takes effect, and immediately Lizzy notices Harrim, Valerie, and Amiri. Lizzy talks with the Frost Giant and convinces it to let us pass in a friendly manner. They ask about the Frost Giant, and Lizzy argues it's a big friend now. Kairos remembers everything about Frost Giants, including how hostile and evil they can be. Even though the giant isn't attacking, there's a lot of hostile air, and Amiri and Valerie in particular consider attacking the giant. 

Kairos argues that we can't break a certain deal, as it would violate the second River Freedom. Lizzy tries a last attempt at letting us pass, and convinces the giant to let us pass and leave the castle. Valerie isn't happy, but accepts our answer, while Amiri is extremely mad about our choice.

We search the final rooms, including the local pantry and the servant quarters. We find a fair amount of gold, weapons, and armor that we take with us. 

We take some time to calm down Amiri. We enter the great hall.
