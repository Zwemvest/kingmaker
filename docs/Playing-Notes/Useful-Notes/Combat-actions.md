Keywords: 
### [Attack](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=220)
An ability with this trait involves an attack. For each attack you make beyond the first on your turn, you take a multiple attack penalty. Your second attack takes a –5 penalty, and any subsequent attacks take a –10 penalty. The multiple attack penalty doesn’t apply to attacks you make when it isn’t your turn (such as attacks made as part of a reaction). You can use a weapon with the [agile](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=170) trait to reduce your multiple attack penalty.

### [Manipulate](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=104)
You must physically manipulate an item or make gestures to use an action with this trait. Creatures without a suitable appendage can’t perform actions with this trait. Manipulate actions often trigger reactions.

### [Move](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=114)
An action with this trait involves moving from one space to another.

### [Reckless](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=285)
Actions with the reckless trait run the risk of the pilot losing control of a vehicle. When performing a reckless action, the pilot must first attempt an appropriate piloting check to keep control of the vehicle.
