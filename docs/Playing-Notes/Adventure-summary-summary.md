[[../Places/Nation/Brevoy.md]] is a country consisting of two parts, [[../Places/Nation/Issia.md]] and [[../Places/Nation/Rostland.md]]. [[Calendar.md#Before game start||11 years ago]], the king of [[../Places/Nation/Brevoy.md]] disappeared, and the regent [[../Creatures/Individuals/Noleski-Surtova.md|Noleski Surtova, Lord of Rostland]], took over. Ever since then, [[../Places/Nation/Brevoy.md]] has been teetering on civil war. 

Surtova has some allies in the [[../Creatures/Organizations/Aldori-Swordlords.md|Aldori Swordlords]], but they refuse to aid him directly. Instead, they've convinced him to settle a region south of [[../Places/Nation/Rostland.md]], that [[../Places/Nation/Rostland.md]] claimed but could never really claim dominion over: the [[../Places/River-Kingdoms/Stolen-Lands.md|Stolen Lands]]. An ally in that region would make Surtova's position a lot stronger, diplomatically, militarily, and politically. 

The [[../Places/River-Kingdoms/Stolen-Lands.md|Stolen Lands]] are a dangerous region, full of [[../Creatures/Organizations/Bandits.md]], where [[../Creatures/Monsters/Fey.md]] presence seems to be stronger than usual. Nobody in history has ever held the [[../Places/River-Kingdoms/Stolen-Lands.md|Stolen Lands]] as a kingdom for long. Since neither the [[../Creatures/Organizations/Aldori-Swordlords.md|Swordlords]] nor Surtova can spare any troops, adventurers will have to settle the dangerous region. Guess who those adventurers are?
