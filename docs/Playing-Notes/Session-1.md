# Session 1
## 25 Calistril 4710
The scene in the great hall is one of chaos and destruction, with tables turned into barricades and blood staining the floor. Guards stand vigilant, and the atmosphere is tense as the party recounts their encounter with assassins and frost giants. They explain their actions to a guard who immediately starts questioning them but eventually understands their predicament. After some persuasion, the guard introduces himself as [[Ivenzi]]. He is a tall man with grey eyes, short black hair, prominent eyebrows, and a short mustache.

[[Ivenzi]] informs the party of the situation: mercenaries and various types of giants have infiltrated the manor, forcing all guards to gather in the grand hall while [[Jamandi-Aldori|Lady Jamandi]] Aldori leads the effort to clear the rest of the building. Some attackers have fled into the west wing, while others went in the east wing where the party came from. Smoke billows from underneath closed doors, indicating fires raging behind.

[[Djames]] fashions some primitive yet effective gas masks, to mitigate the effects of the smoke. The masks consisted of pieces of cloth soaked in water, which would then be tied around the faces of the wearers to act as a barrier against the smoke inhalation. 

[[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] uses a Slashing Gust to clear the rest of the smoke. When [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] uses her Slashing Gust spell, her appearance changes in a remarkable way. Her limbs elongate and multiply, resembling a myriad of branches and tendrils. These new appendages sway and twist with a bizarre grace, almost as if they possess a life of their own. With each wave and motion, the branches and limbs generate powerful gusts of wind, slicing through the air with a sharp and cutting force. Leaves and debris whirl around her as the wind intensifies, creating a whirlwind effect that helps to disperse the smoke and clear the air. Meanwhile, [[Djames]] would scan the hallway for flammable objects, but sensed they had already been removed from this hallway. 

As the smoke began to dissipate, revealing a hall seemingly free of flames, our attention turned to the bedrooms adjacent to the corridor. Recognizing the potential danger for any survivors within, we resolved to investigate each room, closing off those engulfed in fire to contain the smoke.

[[Leonardo]] took charge of examining the first room, while [[Djames]] and [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] ventured into the second, leaving [[Kairos]] to explore a third chamber on her own. Most of the doors of the rooms had already burned away, and the room [[Kairos]] went into didn't seem to be on fire at all, being an open room connected to the hallway.

Inside the open room, [[Kairos]] encountered a solemn scene - a polished floor marred by smoke stains and an armored statue depicting a half-elf woman. This statue represented [[Milani]] the [[Everbloom]], a deity revered by those who championed the oppressed. 

Meanwhile, [[Leonardo]]'s investigation led him to a chamber already ravaged by fire, offering little hope of finding survivors.

In the largest bedroom, [[Djames]] and [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] faced a sudden onslaught as they opened the door—a rush of flames surged into the hallway. [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]], undeterred, continued to manipulate her branches, attempting to stave off the advancing blaze. With quick thinking, [[Djames]] tossed a waterskin to [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] and assessed the situation—the beds ablaze, the door smoldering. Acting swiftly, [[Djames]] utilized the water from the skin to douse the flames, preventing further escalation of the inferno.

As [[Djames]] passed the waterskin to [[Leonardo]], each member of the party sprang into action to combat the encroaching flames. [[Kairos]], entering a fourth room, valiantly fought against the fire, but soon found herself inside a searing heat. [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]], wielding her branches like a makeshift extinguisher, joined the effort, managing to quell some of the flames within the room.

Meanwhile, [[Djames]] began channeling tales of heroism to bolster [[Kairos]]' resolve. Amidst the recitation, [[Kairos]] couldn't help but be puzzled by the embellished accounts of her past woven into [[Djames]]'s narrative, but was inspired by the grand epic that [[Djames]] appeared to be making up on the spot.

As [[Leonardo]] approached the group, he bestowed his guidance upon [[Kairos]], empowering her efforts. Determined, [[Kairos]] seized her waterskin, pouring its contents onto the fire until it was depleted. Despite her valiant efforts, the flames continued to rage, and in her attempt to stamp them out, [[Kairos]] suffered burns of her own.

As [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] continued to fan the flames, [[Djames]]'s inspiring words spurred [[Kairos]] on, although she remained puzzled by the bard's knowledge of her past. [[Leonardo]], utilizing his prestidigitation, managed to cool down the fire, allowing [[Kairos]] to stomp out the remaining flames in her room.

With determination, [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] proceeded to the final room, using her branches to combat the fire, albeit with some minor burns. [[Leonardo]] swiftly extinguished the flames in the fourth room, rendering it safe. [[Kairos]], undeterred by her previous injuries, attempted to extinguish the fires in the last room but struggled to make significant progress, sustaining further burns in the process. Fortunately, [[Djames]]'s protective magic shielded [[Kairos]] from harm as he continued his inspiring narrative.

[[Leonardo]] employs his Prestidigitation magic to snuff out the lingering flames in the final room. Together, [[Djames]], [[Leonardo]], and [[Kairos]] make their way into the shrine of [[Milani]], taking a moment to recenter themselves and offer prayers to the gods. [[Kairos]] directs her prayers to [[Pharasma]], while [[Leonardo]] and [[Djames]] pay homage to [[Milani]], seeking guidance and protection in their endeavor.

As [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] ventures into the next hall, her eyes fall upon the unconscious figure of [[Tartuccio]], sprawled on the ground as if attempting to flee one of the bedrooms. With a gentle touch of her branches, [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] manages to stabilize him, coaxing him back to consciousness. However, the gratitude quickly dissipates as [[Tartuccio]]'s abrasive nature resurfaces, demanding to be escorted back to the great hall.

Despite his sharp words, [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] offers her support, aiding him as they make their way through the corridors. Inadvertently, a misstep causes [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]]'s branches to brush against [[Tartuccio]], eliciting a sharp reaction from him. In his frustration, [[Tartuccio]] lashes out at [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]], further upsetting her. Overwhelmed by the confrontation, [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] finds herself succumbing to tears, the emotional strain of the situation taking its toll.

As the rest of the party concludes their moment of meditation, they emerge from the shrine to find [[Tartuccio]] storming through the halls, his demeanor still as confrontational as ever. [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] remains in the hallway, tears staining her cheeks, as [[Tartuccio]]'s presence only adds to the tension.

In a display of defiance, [[Tartuccio]] addresses the party, dubbing them his "little helpers" and demanding their assistance. [[Leonardo]], unwilling to entertain his demands, sternly instructs him to be silent, while [[Djames]] launches into an impassioned tirade extolling the virtues of House Lebeda.

Unfazed by the threats, [[Tartuccio]] continues on his way, prompting [[Leonardo]] and [[Kairos]] to step forward. [[Leonardo]] attempts to impede his progress, while [[Kairos]] plays a mischievous prank on [[Tartuccio]] with magic by casting Telekinetic Hand to throw his robe over his eyes.

As the party moves forward, they come across [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]], still visibly upset and crying in one of the rooms. [[Leonardo]], showing compassion, approaches her and attempts to offer comfort. He gently wipes away a single large bubble of green snot from [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]]'s nostrils before helping her to her feet, offering his support in this trying moment.

From here, we find ourselves in a cross-roads between two rooms. [[Leonardo]] bursts into the first room, a lavishly decorated space featuring a pool table, only to find [[Jaethal]] tied to one of the plush chairs. Frustrated and alarmed, [[Leonardo]] demands an explanation, but a loud voice interrupts him, claiming to be busy. [[Gomi]], floating above [[Leonardo]]'s head, adds to the chaos. Undeterred, [[Leonardo]] rallies the party to stand together for House Lebeda's honor. Inside the room, three assailants await.

Meanwhile, [[Kairos]] steps into a second room cluttered with weapon and armor racks, most of them empty or in disarray. Hearing commotion from the neighboring room, [[Kairos]] swiftly returns to assist. She immediately engages one of the assailants with a spellstrike, dealing lethal blows that ultimately lead to the assailant's demise. However, another attacker turns their attention to [[Leonardo]], launching a swift assault that catches him off guard, leaving him temporarily vulnerable.

[[Djames]] continues to lament on the successes of House Lebeda to inspire [[Leonardo]], as he casts Daze on one of the assailants to blast them with a mental shock. Meanwhile, [[Leonardo]] retaliates against the attacker who initially struck him, bolstered by [[Djames]]' courageous words. With a powerful swing, [[Leonardo]] strikes at the assailant, but unfortunately misses his mark after crossing the room.

[[Gomi]] joins the fray, unleashing an Electric Arc attack that the assailant narrowly evades, still taking some damage from the residual shock. [[Kairos]], employing Arcane Cascade and utilizing Time Sense to enhance her precision, delivers a precise strike with her [[Elf|Elven]] Fauchard. [[Djames]] contributes by attempting to demoralize the assailant further.

Working together, the party subdues the [[Bandits|bandit]], inflicting non-lethal damage and securing them with manacles and a gag to prevent further resistance.

After freeing [[Jaethal]] from her restraints, the party attempts to heal her using [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]]'s natural abilities, but unfortunately, there is no response. Concerned, [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] notes the absence of a heartbeat from [[Jaethal]], indicating something unusual about her condition.

[[Jaethal]] inquires about the fire situation, and upon learning that the halls are now safe, she agrees to return to the great hall. [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] makes another observation about [[Jaethal]]'s lack of heartbeat, prompting the party to urge [[Jaethal]] to accompany them back to the main hall, along with the captured prisoner.

In the next room, the party discovers polished white tiles adorning the floor, along with an array of trophy heads mounted on the walls. Among the trophies are heads of a stag, an owl, a wolf, and various reptilian monsters. While exploring, [[Kairos]] uncovers a Bloodseeker Beak Talisman, a valuable find amidst the trophies. [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]], intrigued by the collection of dead animals, thoroughly examines them but doesn't find anything noteworthy.

As the party cautiously approaches the next room, they hear noises emanating from within. [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] decides to send in [[Gomi]] to scout the area, carefully opening the door just enough for the familiar to slip through. With bated breath, [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] observes through [[Gomi]]'s eyes as they spot two Frost [[Giants]] engaged in battle. [[Kairos]] and [[Leonardo]] prepare their Runic Weapon spells, as they get ready to join in on the fray.

Inside the dueling arena, [[Jamandi-Aldori|Lady Jamandi]] Aldori is locked in combat with the towering Frost [[Giants]], her skills tested against their immense strength. Without hesitation, [[Kairos]] and [[Leonardo]] rush in to join the fray, ready to lend their aid to their noble leader.

The arena is vast, its walls padded and adorned with various weapons and armors, providing ample cover for the intense battle unfolding within. Despite the formidable foes already present, the arrival of new assailants through an adjoining door signals that the danger is far from over, prompting the party to brace themselves for yet another round of combat. 

As the chaos unfolds in the dueling arena, amidst the clash of swords and the roar of giants, [[Jamandi-Aldori|Lady Jamandi]] Aldori's commanding voice cuts through the tumult, directing the party's attention to a formidable figure among the assailants. Clad in black chainmail and wielding a massive battle-axe with deadly precision, this woman stands out as the leader of the [[Black-Tears|Black Tears]], a group notorious for their nefarious deeds. We would later find out her name is [[Volodmyra]], and she is the leader of the attackers, a group called the [[Black-Tears|Black Tears]].

As the battle unfolds in the dueling arena, [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] takes the initiative by unleashing a crackling Electric Arc, targeting two of the attackers with bolts of lightning. Meanwhile, [[Djames]] employs a Command spell, compelling one of the Frost [[Giants]] to relinquish its weapon, momentarily disrupting its offensive capabilities.

Responding swiftly to the chaos, [[Jamandi-Aldori|Lady Jamandi]] Aldori demonstrates her formidable prowess by severing the arm of a Frost Giant with a decisive blow from her weapon. [[Leonardo]] charges into the fray with his greatsword, effortlessly dispatching an assailant in a single powerful strike.

[[Kairos]] joins the melee, erecting a protective Shield spell around herself before unleashing a cascade of arcane energy, surrounded herself by shimmering runes that glow with otherworldly power. [[Djames]] employs another Command spell to instil fear in an assailant, compelling it to flee from the battle, and continues to support his allies, [[Djames]] by unleashing another another inspiring anthem, rallying [[Leonardo]] with words of courage as the battle rages on in the dueling arena.

With steely determination, [[Leonardo]] unleashes a fearsome display of intimidation, causing one of the [[bandits]] to falter in fear before swiftly dispatching him with a lethal blow from his weapon. In a fluid motion, he pivots to engage another assailant, delivering a devastating strike that swiftly ends their threat.

Meanwhile, [[Kairos]] taps into the arcane energies swirling around her, teleporting through the runes adorning her body to unleash a Spellstrike of unparalleled power. As her strikes connect, it seems as though claws from different timelines converge, guided by the glowing runes, culminating in a devastating critical hit that leaves a significant impact on their foe. [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] finishes the assailant off. 

Upon searching the body of [[Volodmyra]], the party discovers several valuable items:
1. Trackers Goggles
2. +1 Greataxe
3. Chainmail
4. 4 lesser healing potions
5. 5 minor healing potions
6. A jade and pearl necklace (worth 20 gp)
7. A silver ring (worth 30 gp)

The party decides to divide the potions they found among themselves. This ensures that each member of the party has a basic supply of healing potions to use as needed during their adventures in the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]].

As the party takes a moment to catch their breath and survey their surroundings, they are drawn to a magnificent window that offers a breathtaking view of Northern [[Brevoy]]. The first light of dawn begins to peek over the horizon, casting a warm glow over the city of [[Restov]]. With the sun's gentle ascent, the city gradually comes to life, its buildings and streets bathed in the soft morning light. It's a serene and peaceful sight, a moment of tranquility amidst the chaos and turmoil they've faced.

After wrapping up her affairs, [[Jamandi-Aldori|Lady Jamandi]] Aldori extends her gratitude to the party for their steadfast defense of the manor. In a reciprocal gesture, the party returns the safeguarded guard wages to [[Jamandi-Aldori|Lady Aldori]], reinforcing their commitment to aiding and protecting the interests of House Aldori and the stability of the region.

[[Jamandi-Aldori|Lady Jamandi]] Aldori generously distributes rewards to each member of the party as a token of appreciation for their valorous efforts in safeguarding the manor. Each member receives two lesser healing potions to aid in their future endeavors, along with a sum of 50 gold coins, further recognizing their contributions and dedication to the cause.

Gathering in the great hall after several hours, we witness the impressive efficiency of the manor's staff in restoring order and tidying up the aftermath of the attack. [[Jamandi-Aldori|Lady Jamandi]] addresses the assembled survivors, her resolve unwavering despite the recent turmoil. She emphasizes that this attack will not deter her from her mission and the vision she holds for the future.

As a gesture of her unwavering resolve, [[Jamandi-Aldori|Jamandi Aldori]] stresses that it's time to send four different groups into the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]]. 

- **[[Iron-Wraiths|Iron Wraiths]]**: Tasked with operating in the [[Glenebon-Uplands|Glenebon Uplands]], their mission involves defeating the [[Tiger-Lords|Tiger Lords]], a formidable adversary, and establishing diplomatic relations with Pitax, a crucial diplomatic endeavor.
- **Baron [[Hannis-Drelev|Hannis Drelev]]**: Given the responsibility of securing the [[Hooktongue-Slough|Hooktongue Slough]] region, Baron Drelev's mission focuses on establishing control over the eastern [[Sellen-River|Sellen River]], a strategic waterway vital for trade and defense.
- **[[Maegar-Varn|Maegar Varn]]**: Stationed in the [[Nomen-Heights|Nomen Heights]], [[Maegar-Varn|Maegar Varn]] oversees the development of a town fortified by a Varnling host. Additionally, his mission involves establishing an alliance with the centaurs and overseeing the operations of an Aldori dueling school, aiming to foster martial prowess and unity.
- **Lebeda Expedition**: Tasked with exploring and pacifying the [[Greenbelt]] and [[Narlmarches]] regions, the Lebeda Expedition aims to establish a presence in these untamed wilderness areas, paving the way for future settlement and expansion under the banner of House Lebeda.

[[Jamandi-Aldori|Jamandi Aldori]] recommends that the party begin their endeavors at a trading post that has been severely affected by [[Bandits|bandit]] activity. This suggests that restoring order and security to this trading post would not only serve as a crucial first step in stabilizing the region but also demonstrate the party's capability in dealing with threats to commerce and safety, laying the groundwork for further expansion and development.

Now that [[Aldori-Manor|Aldori Manor]] is safe, we catch a few hours more sleep. In the morning, [[Kairos]] heads into [[Restov]] to sell different parts of [[Bandits|bandit]] loot. [[Djames]] and [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] also head into [[Restov]]; [[Djames]] with the intention of purchasing new high-fashion clothing, while [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] places orders for a new dress and robes. Additionally, [[Djames]] sends a coded letter to [[Lander-Lebeda|Lander Lebeda]], using secret phrases to hint at their clandestine connection.

[[Kairos]] also invests in a donkey pack mule to assist with transportation and carrying supplies on their upcoming ventures.

## 28 Calistril 4710
Armed with a detailed map of the region, the party notes key regions in the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]], such as the [[Narlmarches]], the [[Greenbelt]], the [[Nomen-Heights|Nomen Heights]], the [[Tors-of-Levenies|Tors of Levenies]], and the [[Dunsward]]. We also mark the [[Rostland]] Hinterlands, of which [[Olegs-Trading-Post|Oleg's Trading Post]] is a part. Our initial travels towards [[Olegs-Trading-Post|Oleg's Trading Post]] will take us past [[Nivaktas-Crossing|Nivakta's Crossing]], and the [[Crooked-Falls|Crooked Falls]]. 

With advance notice from [[Jamandi-Aldori|Jamandi Aldori]], [[Olegs-Trading-Post|Oleg's Trading Post]] was prepared for the party's arrival. Accompanied by the traders, we journeyed downstream along the [[Shrike-River|Shrike River]]. After three days of travel, we finally arrived at [[Olegs-Trading-Post|Oleg's Trading Post]], where [[Oleg-Leveton|Oleg Leveton]], his wife [[Svetlana-Leveton|Svetlana Leveton]], and the other inhabitants were expecting our arrival.

Upon our arrival at [[Olegs-Trading-Post|Oleg's Trading Post]], we are warmly welcomed by [[Svetlana-Leveton|Svetlana Leveton]], who invites us inside, mentioning that stew and bread are already cooking on the stove. As we settle down outside near the fire, we hear the sound of hammering coming from the roof of the trading post. [[Oleg-Leveton|Oleg]] pauses his work and descends from the trading post to join us.

[[Oleg-Leveton|Oleg]] welcomes us with a brusque tone, inquiring if we're here to assist with the [[Bandits|bandit]] situation. [[Kairos]] attempts a jest about being here to help _against_ the [[bandits]], which [[Oleg-Leveton|Oleg]] doesn't find amusing. [[Djames]] quickly offers an apology on behalf of the group. Both [[Djames]] and [[Kairos]] then proceed to explain our mission, clarifying that we've been dispatched by [[Jamandi-Aldori|Jamandi Aldori]].

[[Djames]] reiterates our intention to bring civilization to the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]], a sentiment that [[Oleg-Leveton|OIeg]] appears to dismiss. [[Kairos]] chimes in, highlighting the potential increase in trade such civilization might bring to [[Oleg-Leveton|Oleg]]. However, [[Oleg-Leveton|Oleg]] remains unimpressed, emphasizing his immediate need for assistance against the [[bandits]] demanding "taxes". Despite [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]]'s offer to aid in repairing the housing, [[Oleg-Leveton|Oleg]] doesn't seem swayed by our goodwill gestures. [[Oleg-Leveton|Oleg]] emphasizes that he relocated to a remote and quiet area of [[Rostland]] precisely for the tranquility and solitude it offers.

[[Kairos]] inquires about [[Oleg-Leveton|Oleg]]'s [[Bandits|bandit]] problem, prompting [[Oleg-Leveton|Oleg]] to explain that the [[bandits]] typically arrive once a month, consistently on the first day of the month, precisely at the crack of dawn. When [[Leonardo]] probes for further details regarding the size and armament of the [[Bandits|bandit]] groups, [[Oleg-Leveton|Oleg]] reveals that initially, they arrived with a few dozen individuals, but over time, their numbers have dwindled with each subsequent visit.

To fortify the trading post, the group decides on a strategic plan. They opt to dig Spike Traps around the perimeter, which will be triggered by [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]]'s Timber cantrip. [[Djames]] and [[Oleg-Leveton|Oleg]] will collaborate to create distractions or obstacles to hinder the [[bandits]] before they launch their attack. Additionally, they plan to strategically position the carts to funnel the [[bandits]] towards the spike traps. Furthermore, they intend to prepare a kettle of hot sand above the entrance to the trading post as a secondary trap that can be deployed against any reinforcements. This strategy aimed to maximize the trading post's defenses and repel the [[Bandits|bandit]] threat effectively.

We also asked [[Oleg-Leveton|Oleg]] and [[Svetlana-Leveton|Svetlana]] to remain as far back into the safest room of [[Olegs-Trading-Post|Oleg's Trading Post]] as they could, but both refused. Though [[Oleg-Leveton|Oleg]] agreed that [[Svetlana-Leveton|his wife]] should be kept safe, he thought it'd be suspicious to the [[bandits]] if he and [[Svetlana-Leveton|Svetlana]] weren't present. 
### Summary
- Took three days to travel to [[Olegs-Trading-Post|Olegs Trading Post]]
- Met [[Oleg-Leveton|Oleg Leveton]] and [[Svetlana-Leveton|Svetlana Leveton]]
## 1 Pharast 4710
The group dedicates the entire day to constructing the traps, and when the [[bandits]] finally arrive, the traps prove to be more effective than anticipated. In a swift turn of events, two [[bandits]] are crushed by a falling tree, another falls victim to the spike trap, while a fourth, identified as [[Happs-Bydon|Happs Bydon]], is captured alive. They swiftly secure [[Happs-Bydon|Happs Bydon]], binding him with ropes, and commence interrogation to gather information about their adversaries. [[Happs-Bydon|Happs Bydon]] reveals that they are aligned with a woman named [[Kressle]], who he warns will soon retaliate against them.

As the interrogation intensifies, Happs becomes increasingly agitated, defying the group's threats and demanding to know the strength of their army. [[Kairos]] responds by delivering a swift punch to his face, asserting dominance. Meanwhile, [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]], [[Leonardo]], and [[Djames]] continue pressing him for information about his employer and the location of their stronghold. Despite their efforts, Happs remains obstinate, repeatedly insisting that [[Kressle]] will soon arrive. Unfazed by his defiance, the party reiterates their fearlessness and determination to confront [[Kressle]].
### Summary
- Defeated several [[bandits]] and captured and interrogated [[Happs-Bydon|Happs Bydon]]
