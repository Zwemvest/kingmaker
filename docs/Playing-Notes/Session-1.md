# Session 1
TODO: First Frost Giant in session 0 was an ogre, not a Frost Giant.

## 25 Calistril 4710
The great hall looks much different than during the feast. Three tables have been turned up to the side - turned up to the southern door as a barricade. Blood and bodies line the floor. The guards gather at the barricades. Tapestries have been torn from the worn, trying to prevent smoke from rising into the great hall.

A guard questions us. We tell it that we were ambushed by assassins and frost giants. We mention a single frost giant got away. The guard gets angry at us for letting the frost giant go. We attempt to convince that we made a deal with the frost giant in the name of Jamandi Aldori, and that we had no choice in following a nobleman. He is finally convinced, and the guard introduces himself as Ivenzy, a tall man with grey eyes and a short cut black hear, and huge eyebrows with a short mustache. 

He tells us multiple mercenaries and giants got in (multiple types of ginats, not just frost giants). All guards were collected in the grand hall, and Jamandi moved on to clear the manor. A number of attackers fled into the west wing, the rest fled into the east wing (where we came from). 

Heavy smoking is coming from underneath from underneath the closed doors to the hall and the staircase. The final door is to the toilets. It's clear that everything underneath is on fire. Djames prepares some primitative smoke masks for us, with cloth and some running water. Djames also provides guidance for Lizzy, who grows a large amount of branches and limbs, using them to cast the Slashing Gust spell. Waving her branches and limbs, she tries to clear the smoke. All flammable items have been removed from the hallway.

We see the smoke clear up, and though the hall doesn't appear to be on fire, the bedroom doors get a lot of smoke into the hallway. We decide to check the several bedrooms for survivors, and to close off the bedrooms from smoke if we see that there's only fire in the rooms. We split up, Leonardo checking the first room, Djames and Lizzy the second, and Kairos the final.

Kairos enters an open room, with a polished floor stained with smoke. Armored statue with a half elf woman, with a shield, other hand clenched over her heart. This Milani the Everbloom, a deity for those who fight against oppression, rewarding those who fight for the weaker and those who cannot defend herselves. Resting or meditating in the room for 1 minute counts a full rest.

Leonardo enters a room where everything already appears to be fully burned down, while Lizzy and Djames offer the biggest bedroom. As soon as they open the door, a raging fire flows into the great hall. Lizzy continues waving her branches and throws a waterskin to Djames. Djames sees the beds on fire, the door smoldering. Djames extinguishes the flames using the waterskin. 

Finally, he walks up to Leonardo and hands over the waterskin to Leonardo, who also uses it to extinguish the flames in his room. Kairos enters a third room and begins extinguishing the flames, which successfully works at first, but she starts getting burned as she goes on. Lizzy continues to fan with her branches, but now walks into a room to extinguish the flames with her branches. She succeeds in extinguishing them somewhat. 

Djames begins to cast a Hymn of Healing on Kairos so that Kairos gains some temporary hit points every turn. Djames does this by writing heroic tales about the party, reading out loud, but Kairos is bewonderd by the obvious lies Djames is listing, wondering how Djames knows about her past. Djames ends by walking closer to the party. Leonardo walks to the party, and casts Guidance on Kairos. Kairos grabs her waterskin, tries to extinguish more flames, and empties it completely on the fire. She ends by stepping into the room to stomp out more fire, but burns herself in the process.

Lizzy continues to fan, and again fans out more flames. Djames sustains his words about Kairos'  actions. Kairos is still bewondered by Djames. Leonardo uses his prestidigitation to cool down the fire. Kairos stomps out the final fires in the room. 

Lizzy walks to the final room, and she waves her branches again. She also tries to guard against the fire, but her branches still burn a little bit. Leonardo extinguishes the fires in the fourth room, and the room is finally safe now. Kairos walks past Lizzy, into the final room, and tries to stomp out the fires, but sadly, doesn't achieve a lot, only burning herself in the process. Luckily, Djames'  magic protects Kairos. Djames sustains his writing.

Leonardo uses prestidigitation to extinguish the final flames. Djames, Leonardo, and Kairos enter the shrine of Milani, taking some time to refocus and pray to the Gods. Kairos prays to Pharasma, and Leonardo and Djames to Milnai herself. 

Meanwhile, Lizzy enters the next hall and sees an unconscious Tartuccio. Lizzy hangs over him, very close with all the branches, and stabilizes Tartuccio. He soon returns to consciousness, very grateful to what Lizzy did, but also demands to be returned to the great hall. Lizzy supports him as they walk back to the great hall. Lizzy accidentally hurts Tartuccio a bit as Tartuccio gets mad at Lizzy for hurting her. As Tartuccio is mean, Lizzy starts crying. 

The rest of the party stops refocussing after a minute of meditation, and Tartuccio angrily walks through the halls as the party spots him, Lizzy still crying in the hall. Tartuccio calls us his little helpers and requests that we help him, as Leonardo asks him to shut up. Djames starts a beautiful rant and display of House Lebeda as Leonardo threathens Tartuccio. 

Tartuccio is not intimidated. He walks on, as Leonardo starts to prevent him from moving and Kairos plays a prank by casting Telekinetic Hand on his robe, throwing his robe over his eyes. 

We walk on. We find Lizzy crying in a room, and Leonardo tries to comfort her. A single big bubble of green snot is on Lizzy's nostrils. Leonardo helps Lizzy up.

Leonardo enters the first room, a beautifully decorated room with a pool table. Jaethal is tied down on one of the comfortable chairs. Leonardo yells, as he enters the room; " WHAT IN THE NAME OF HOUSE LEBEDA IS GOING ON?". A loud voice responds, "WHAT IS THIS, CAN'T YOU TELL I'M BUSY?" as Gomi floats over Leonardo's head. Leonardo encourages the entire party to join in for House Lebeda. In the room are three assailants. 

Kairos enters a second room, a room filled with weapon racks and armor racks. Most are empty, but discarded pieces are strewn across the floor. 

Kairos hears the first room being opened, walks back, and immediately spellstrikes on one assailant. The assailant retaliates, and then dies from the wounds that Kairos had inflicted. Another assailant walks up to Leonardo and attacks twice, making Leonardo temporarily flat-footed. 

Djames starts to murmer on his writings again to Leondardo, starting a courageous anthem. Djames then casts Daze on another attacker. The attacker takes a mental jolt to the face. 

Leonardo attacks back to the attacker that initially attacked. He starts a brave anthem on House Lebeda's power, then makes a power attack on the attacker. He enters the room, walks over the pool table, and attacks again, but sadly misses. 

Gomi enters the room and uses an Electric Arc attack. The attacker manages to mostly dodge, but still takes the brunt of an attack. Kairos enters Arcane Cascade, casts Time Sense to help with timing, and then makes a strike attack with her Elven Fauchard. Djames responds by demoralizing. We deal some non-lethal damage, and arrest the bandit by using manacles and a gag on him.

We free up Jaethal, by removing the gag and the ropes that tie her up. Lizzy tries to heal up Jaethal by using her natural healing, but it fails to have any effect. 

Jaethal asks about the fire. We tell her that the fire is extinguished and the halls are safe, that she can return back to the great hall. Lizzy once again tries to point out a lack of heartbeat from Jaethal. We ask Jaethal to return to the great hall, and take the new prisoner with her. 

The next room has polished white tiles, and various trophy heads, including a stag, an owl, a worlf, and reptillian monsters. Kairos finds a Bloodseeker Talisman. Lizzy checks out more of the dead animals, but to no avail.

We hear noises coming from the next room. Lizzy decides to send in Gomi to check the new room, so we open the room a little bit so Gomi can go in. Lizzy cautiously has Gomi look in. We spot two Frost Giants. Several of the assailants, ogres, and Aldori guards have already perished in better. Lizzy tries diplomacy with the giants, as Kairos and Leonardo rush in to attack.

It's a large area, padded with walls and armors. Lady Jamandi is fighting two Frost Giants. As soon as we enter, another door opens and new assailants rush in. We prepare for combat. 

Lizzy opens the combat with an Electric Arc attack. She attacks 2 of the attackers. Djames starts with a Command spell and orders one of the Frost Giants to drop their weapon. Jamandi attacks by chopping off one of the arms of a Frost Giant. Leonardo responds by running into combat and piercing with his greatsword. He strikes an assailant in his charge that just dies instantly. 

Kairos runs in, casts a Shield spell, and enters Arcane Cascade. Visually, runes begin to appear and glow around Kairos in the air. One of the bandits runs towards Djames to attack, and strikes for a measly 4 damage. Another two attempt to flank Leonardo to attack him, but don't manage to inflict a lot of damage. 

Lizzy uses a Needle Darts attack. She projects gold beads towards an attack that tries to attack Djames. Djames uses a Command spell to scare one of the attackers, commanding it to run away from combat. He begins to write, yelling out another courageous anthem towards Leonardo. 

Leonardo intimidates another bandit, demoralizes, and drills his weapon into an attacker, killing him. He then sweeps around and attacks the other bandit that was flanking him. He kills both attackers in one go.

Kairos teleports through the rune and uses a Spellstrike. Several claws seemingly appear from different timelines, as all the runes on Kairos' body glow and she strikes for a massive critical hit. On her body, we find Trackers Goggles and a +1 Greataxe, and chainmail, 4 lesser healing potions, a jade and pearl necklace (worth 20 gp), silver ring (worth 30gp). We also find 5 minor healing potions. 

We look upon a beautiful great window that looks out over Northern Brevoy. We return all guard pay to Jamandi. 

Jamandi Aldori gives each of us 2 lesser healing potions and 50 gold per person. 

We move back to the great hall. The surviving heroes are present, and it appears a lot of the staff has restored parts of the manor. Jamandi speeches to us, saying this attack will not dissuade her. She bestows 4 charters

- Iron Wraiths: Glebon Uplands, defeat the Tiger Lords, open diplomatic relations with Pitax
- Baron Hannis Drelev: Hooktongue Slough, secure the east Sellen River
- Maeger Varn: Nomen Heights, town with a Varnling host, Aldori dueling school. Alliance with the centaurs. 
- Lebeda Expedition: Greenbelt and Narlmarches. 

Jamandi Aldori suggests we can start best at a trading post hit particularly hard by bandits.

Djames enters Restov to buy new high fashion clothing. Lizzy orders a new dress and new robes. Djames also sends a letter to Lander Lebeda, using his secret code words to allude to their secret relationship. 

We sell our loot in Restov, and we buy a donkey pack mule 
## 28 Calistril 4710
We take a map of the area, nothing down the Rostland Hinterlands, Oleg's Trading Post, the Narlmarches, the Greenbelt, Crooked Falls, Nivakta's Crossing, the Dunsward, the Nomen Heights, the Tors of Levenies, and Restov.

Jamandi Aldori sent advance notice to Oleg's trading post, notifying Oleg, his wife Svetlana, and the other inhabitants of our probable arrival there. We arrive there after 3 days of travel.

We are welcomed by Svetlana, who welcomes us in, saying the stew and bread are already on the stove. We hear hammering from the roof of the trading post. We sit down outside, near the fire. Oleg stops his work, and moves down from the trading post. 

Oleg welcomes us in a short, almost rude manner, asking us if we're to help with the bandits. Kairos makes a snide comment that we're here to help *against* the bandits. Oleg does not appreciate this joke, and Djames apologizes. Djames and Kairos explain our mission here, saying we've been sent by Jamandi Aldori. 

Djames mentions again that we've been meaning to start a society, which Oleg does not seem to appreciate. Kairos also notes that this would mean more trade for Oleg. Oleg is not impressed, noting he mostly needs help against the bandits asking for "taxes". Lizzy offers to help repairing the housing in Oleg's Trading Post. Oleg is again not impressed.

Kairos asks about his bandit problem. Oleg mentions that bandits arrive around once per month. Every month, they've arrived at the first day of the month, in the first hour of daylight. Leonardo asks for more information about the amount of bandits and soldiers coming in, like their numbers and how many arms they're bringing. They first came with a few dozen, but every month, came with less people.  

To fortify the trading post, we decide to dig Spike Traps, and to trigger them with a Timber cantrip from Lizzy. Djames and Oleg will temporarily distract or hamper the bandits before they attack. Finally, we'll move the chart so the bandits will have no choice other than to move towards the spike trap. We'll place hot sand in a big kettle above the entrance too, so we have a second set of traps we can use for reinforcements.

We work the entire day to build the traps, and when they finally come, they prove more effective than we though. Immediately two bandits are crushed under a tree, another one dies in the spike trap, and we capture a fourth, named Happs Bydon. We get him from the spike trap, tie him up in ropes, and interrogate him to ask who he works for. He tells us Kressle will come and get us. 

As we threaten Happs, he gets more and more pissed off, asking us what army we'll bring. Kairos punches him in the face, while Lizzy, Leonardo, and Djames interrogate him. He tells us that Kressle is coming, but he works for another. Djames asks him where his stronghold is. He repeats that Kressle is coming. We tell the bandit that we're not afraid of her.
