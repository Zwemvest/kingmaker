## 2 Pharast 4710
We started the day with our morning preperations. The temperature is average, and there's no real weather effects to detect. 

Djames mentioned that he had sent a letter to the Iron Wraiths, Hannis Drelev, en Maegar Varn to ask how their expeditions were going. 

Lizzy used her Predict Weather. She and Djames also tried to track the rest of the herd of boars that tried to attack us during the night, leaving signals for Leonardo and Kairos to track later.  They had no trouble tracking the herd, but also found human trails that lead deeper into the woods. Djames keeps up his uplifting performance to encourage Lizzy into the track, and Lizzy keeps tracking the humans. 

Lizzy deduced the human tracks were probably from the bandit camp of Krezzle, who Habbs told us about (Krezzle was hiding somewhere around this forest). 

In the meantime, Leonardo and Kairos prepare the meat by slicing it and smoking it with prestidigitation. We pack up the camp after about 2 hours of prepping the meat, then have no problem finding the sings of Lizzy and tracking Lizzy and Djames. 

Djames waits for Kairos and Leonardo to arrive, while Lizzy tries to find the camp, trying to hide away from it while asking Gomi to spy on the bandits here. Gomi sees multiple bandits, chopping wood, talking to one another, sometimes looking around the camp. The bandits mention "little shits", stealing from shipments that are supposed to go to the Stag Lord. 

Our plan is to attack the camp from multiple directions. Kairos will take a bandit on a higher platform, Lizzy will go around the back and cast Sleep, and Leonardo will hide nearby. Meanwhile, Djames will approach them head-on and try to distract them with diplomacy. 

Djames asks for a friendly face, but the bandits are in no way friendly. Everything changes when Djames tries to lie about being a wine trader, named "Fred van der Meer". The bandits immediately turn more friendly and invite Djames to sit with them and talk wines with him. 

We immediately set our plan into motion. Lizzy casts Sleep, and the big bandit Kressle immediately falls asleep, together with one of her lackeys. The other lackey legs it, while Kairos climbs up to take out the lookout. As soon as the bandit legs it, a muffled alarm sounds from further up the river. 

Djames waits a bit. Kressle sleeps, while Kairos kills the lookout using a Spellstrike. The bandit that is legging it tries to flee from the map, while Leonardo uses Athletic Rush to intercept the bandit and then strike it. Leonardo kills the fleeing bandit. Lizzy moves closer to where the alarm sounded from, not hiding, instead running as far forward as she can. 

Djames runs forward to yell for help, acting as if he's part of the bandits. Kairos climbs down, recharges her spellstrike, then moves close to the sleeping bandits. Leonardo uses his Divine Lance, nearly killing the bandit, while Djames uses a Daze spell to knock it out. We capture two bandits and Kressle alive.

We find;
- 4 daggers 
- 4 leather armor
- 1 studded leather armor
- 2 hatchets
- 4 short bows
- 5 silver stag lord amulets (worth 3 gp each)
- 8 days of rations
- lesser healing potion
- 36 gold, 126 silver
- a pair of silver earrings worth 15 gp
- a wooden music box worth 8 gp
- three crates of furs and pelts worth 5 gp per crate
- 8 bottles of herbal liquor, each worth 2 gp.
- mundane supplies, like food, firewood, and tents
- a load of liquor
- 1 lesser thunderstone

Lizzy and Djames capture the final lookout on the final bandit. They try to take the bandit down - Djames casts Guidance while also using his courageous anthem, but accidentally chews Lizzy out. Despite that, they take down the bandit safely.

Kressle does wake up from being tied up, but to no avail. While she struggles, Kairos whips her and asks her to be good. Kairos asks her how loyal she is to the Stag Lord. Kressle responds that she's unbelievably loyal to Stag Lord. Lizzy immidiately threatens to make branches grow inside her face to intimidate Kressle. Unsurprisingly, Kressle is intimidated. Kressle tells us that the Stag Lord is hiding in the Tuskwater encampment. 

Kairos fixed the chart so we can take back the bandits. Inside the chart are all components to make a spike snare. We also take all liquor inside the chart. It turns out the bandits kept all the local treasure inside of the chart. We also find a lesser thunderstone.

We begin travelling back to Oleg's trade post with the chart, but Kairos quickly hears the feet of 2 spiders. We prepare for the attack; Djames reacts with a Courageous Anthem with a Lingerous Composition. 

`+1 on damage rolls, attack rolls, and against fear effects`

Djames also uses a Command spell, but fails to influence any of the spiders. Leonardo draws his weapon, and the sword begins to glow as he casts Runic Weapon. Kairos walks to one of the spiders, draws her weapon, and attacks with a single strike. It's a powerful strike, but doesn't do a whole lot of damage. 

The spider that Kairos just attacked jumps down, attacks with a bite attack, then goes back into the tree. Lizzy casts Slashing Gust on both spiders. The first spider drops dead out of the tree. The second spider retaliates with a web attack. The spider appears to have some lingering issues from the Slashing Gust attack.

Djames uses a Daze attack, then yells at the spider to demoralize it. The spider doesn't understand, but it knows it's demoralized as shit. With a Divine Lance attack, Djames finishes off the spider.

We try to harvest it for 2 special ingedients from the spider, and 2 vials of hunting spider venom

- 2 Special Ingredients
- 2 Vials of Hunting Spider venom

We travel back to Oleg. We arrive at the evening in 2 Pharast 4710. Oleg is satisfied with the prisoners we deliver, at least, under the assumption that guards from Restov will arrive soon to offload them from him. Happs is also still present. 

- Lizzy buys 4 Riding Horses at Oleg's trading post (8gp each)
- We buy the recipe for:
	- Succulunt Sausages (3gp)
	- Jeweled Rice (2gp)
	- Fish-on-a-stick (1gp)
	- Shephards Pie (2gp)
	- Haggis (1gp)
	- Rice and nut pudding (2gp)
	- Broiled Tuskwater Oysters (3gp)

We stay overnight at Oleg's. 
# 3 Pharast 4710
We head back to the forest where we found Kressle. We arrive around noon.

Lizzy again tries to track the boars, and we find a raddish patch. Lizzy recalls that these are moonraddishes. Lizzy knows that moonraddishes are the favorite food of kobold warriors. Exactly as Lizzy says that, we spot several kobold warriors lying in the moonraddish patch.

They scream at Leonardo that the raddishes belong to them, and that we are to leave. Leonardo yells back that we're open to trading. One of the kobolds refuses to bargain and throws dirt at us. 

We interpret this as a call to initiate combat to scare them off. Djames begins his courageous anthem, inspiring all of us. He then throws a Daze on one of the more aggressive kobolds. 

Lizzy uses Slashing Gust to attack 2 of the kobolds. One of the kobolds, the most aggressive one closest to us, dies from the attack. Leonardo moves in to cast an Electric Arc attack. Another one of the kobolds dies, a third kobold with a purple hat taking another fair brunt of the attack. 

Kairos tumbles through time and space to attack with her whip, for nonlethal damage. She knocks out a fourth goblin. The final fifth kobolds tries to chug multiple spears at Kairos, but doesn't hit. Lizzy walks forward, then throws a Needle Darts spell, but also doesn't succeed. 

Kairos switches to her bolas and throws them at him. Kairos then casts Shield. The kobold tries to attack back with a sling, and hits Kairos in the face. Djames ends the encounter by casting Daze again.

Lizzy checks the 2 dead kobolds for loot. 
- 4 leather armor
- 4 slings
- 4 spears
- 2 basic ingredients from moonraddishes 
- Moonraddishes for Svetlana 

We seek to make a camp. Lizzy finds a good camp. Djames tells an inspiring campfire story and organizes a watch. Lizzy tries to scavenge for ingredients, then cook. Lizzy makes Fish-on-a-stick.

`+1 status bonus to Perception`
`For the next 24 hours, the eater can go for up to 17 hours without sleep before becoming fatigued.`

TODO: Kairos & Leonardo can make a skill check to craft something.
