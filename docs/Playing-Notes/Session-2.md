## 1 Pharast 4710
Leonardo continued to interrogate [[Happs-Bydon]] and asked him for where his bandits friends are. He said theyre close to Tuskwater Lake, (TB-3) and on the edge of the Greenbelt (GB-7), where the Thorn River Camp is. Lizzy was less friendly, and tried to put branches under his fingernails.

Oleg tells us we can stay here for free, our meals are free, and we can take the bandit's gear. Tutuduuduu. Oleg's Trading Post can be our homebase. We place Happs inside a deep hole in the ground, and ask Oleg to feed him enough to subsist. 

We buy a simple map from Oleg for 1 gold. 

Oleg's trading post is a level 3 trading post. He can get any level 3 Common items, needs time for Uncommon items, and has serious trouble with Rare items. 

A hex is 12 miles. We travel at 2.5 miles per hour, so we can do about 2 hexes per day. When we travel, Leonardo doffs him armor.

We leave Oleg's around 12:00.

After 4 hours of travel, we find a big graveyard with multiple animal carcasses. Lizzy deduces that they're from a Brush Thylacine, a smaller marsupial carvnivorne - nocutral predator, usually hunts alone but sometimes in packs, at dusk. Harsh reputation, as a bogeyman. It's probably multiple predactors.

It doesn't take long before we run into two different thylacines. Kairos makes a spellstrike and the thylacine retaliates, to practically no effect. Leonardo moves in fast to attack the thylacine too, and another thylacine attacks Leonardo. Leonardo bravely persists. Lizzy tries to climb a rock, three times in six seconds, but sadly keeps falling down every single time.

Kairos enters Arcane Cascade, and recharges spellstrike, then moves. The thylacine attacks Leonardo again, before succumbing to its wounds. Leonardo retaliates towards the second thylacine, and Lizzy finally manages to climb the rock. The second thylacine then tries to flee, but Kairos retaliates with a strong spellstrike. 

Lizzy spends some time healing up Leonardo while we make camp. Lizzy forages for forageables and cooks, Leonardo tells a campfire story, and Kairos organizes a campfire watch. We finish around 18:00. 

Lizzy cooks, and we get a +1 bonus to saving throws from the foods. Leonardo and Kairos make camp together, and try to camouflage the camp. It's not very well camouflaged. We finish around 20:00. 

Gommi maintains the watch inside the camp, while Lizzy relaxes. Kairos casts Light and Time Sense. We spend some time cleaning the clockwork on Kairos and maintaining the android body of Leonardo. Kairos also spends some time with Missy. 

We are awoken in the middle of the night by a flying raccoon as Gommi flies over us to warn us of two different boars try to attack us. Lizzy attacks one of the boars, who immediately charges to attack Kairos in her tent, then flees. Kairos retaliates by using Dimensional Assault by tumbling through space and attacking. Leonardo ends by attacking the boar near his tent.

The boars run towards Lizzy to attack her. Lizzy attacks back, standing on top of a rock, while the boars attack the rocks. 

Kairos does a spellstrike on the boar near her, which Leonardo finishes off. Lizzy uses Inkshot, but sadly, she misses her entire attack. Kairos moves close, recharges her attack, and casts Shield on herself. The boar moves around for a huge charge, running around a giant rock, only to miss Kairos. The boar attacks again, but misses. Leonardo moves in to attack. Lizzy uses Electric Arc to electrify the boar. 

We spend some time healing up, before going back to bed. We take the brisstles, hide, bones, and 100 meals per boar.
