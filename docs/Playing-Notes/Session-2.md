## 1 Pharast 4710
[[Leonardo]] continued to interrogate [[Happs-Bydon|Happs Bydon]], pressing him for the whereabouts of his [[Bandits|bandit]] friends. Under pressure, [[Happs-Bydon|Happs]] revealed that they were located near [[Tuskwater|Tuskwater Lake]] and at the edge of the [[Greenbelt]], specifically at the [[Thorn-River-Camp|Thorn River Camp]]. Meanwhile, [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] took a less friendly approach, trying to extract information by shoving branches under his fingernails.

[[Oleg-Leveton|Oleg]], the owner of [[Olegs-Trading-Post|Oleg's Trading Post]], offered us free lodging and meals, as well as the [[bandits]]' gear. He declared his trading post could serve as our home base. We placed [[Happs-Bydon|Happs]] inside a deep hole in the ground and asked [[Oleg-Leveton|Oleg]] to provide him with just enough food to subsist.

We purchased a simple map from [[Oleg-Leveton|Oleg]] for one gold piece. [[Oleg-Leveton|Oleg]] also mentioned that his trading post could supply most items that are easily available from [[Restov]], but that he'd need time and money to fullfil more complex requests, and had significant difficulty acquiring rare items.
 
`Oleg's Trading Post is rated at level 3, and can supply any common items up to level 3, needs time to procure uncommon items, and has difficulty acquiring rare items.`
 
Knowing that each hex on the map represented 12 miles, and that we travelled at 2.5 miles per hour, we calculated that we could cover about two hexes per day. [[Leonardo]] doffed his armor before we set off. We left [[Olegs-Trading-Post|Oleg's Trading Post]] around noon.

After four hours of travel, we stumbled upon a large graveyard filled with animal carcasses. [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] identified them as victims of a [[Brush-Thylacines|Brush Thylacine]], a smaller nocturnal marsupial carnivore with a harsh reputation as a bogeyman. Though they usually hunted alone, the presence of multiple carcasses suggested a pack.

Soon, we encountered two thylacines. [[Kairos]] initiated the fight with a powerful spellstrike, inflicting a bleeding wound. The creature tried to retaliate, but luckily to little effect. [[Leonardo]] quickly joined the fray, attacking the first thylacine, only to be targeted by the second. Undeterred, [[Leonardo]] fought bravely. [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]], attempting to gain a vantage point, tried and failed to climb a rock three times in rapid succession.

[[Kairos]] entered an Arcane Cascade, recharged her spellstrike, and moved strategically. The first thylacine attacked [[Leonardo]] again before succumbing to its wound from [[Kairos]]' spellstrike. [[Leonardo]] then turned his attention to the second thylacine. [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] finally managed to climb the rock as the second thylacine attempted to flee, but [[Kairos]] struck it down with another powerful spellstrike.

After the battle, [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] tended to [[Leonardo]]'s wounds while we set up camp. [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] foraged for food and cooked, [[Leonardo]] entertained us with a campfire story, and [[Kairos]] organized the watch schedule. By 18:00, we had finished our preparations. [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]]'s cooking was hearty and filling. [[Leonardo]] and [[Kairos]] tried to camouflage the camp, though not very effectively, finishing around 20:00.

`+1 bonus to saving throws from Lizzy's cooking`

[[Gomi]] took the first watch while [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] relaxed. [[Kairos]] used Light and Time Sense to make the camp a little bit homelier. We spent some time maintaining [[Kairos]]'s clockwork and [[Leonardo]]'s android body, and [[Kairos]] also spent time with [[Missy]].

In the middle of the night, [[Gomi]] flew over us to warn of two [[boars]] approaching our camp. The first [[Boars|boar]] charged at [[Kairos]]'s tent after [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] attacked it, then fled. [[Kairos]] responded with a Dimensional Assault, tumbling through space to strike back. [[Leonardo]] engaged the [[Boars|boar]] near his tent.

The [[boars]] then targeted [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]], who fought back from atop a rock while the [[boars]] attacked the base. [[Kairos]] used a spellstrike to attack the [[Boars|boar]] near her, allowing [[Leonardo]] to finish it off. [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] attempted an Inkshot but missed. [[Kairos]] moved closer, recharged her spellstrike, and cast Shield on herself. The remaining [[Boars|boar]] charged around a giant rock to attack [[Kairos]] but missed. [[Leonardo]] then moved in to attack, and [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] used Electric Arc to finish off the [[Boars|boar]].

After the battle, [[Kairos]]' tent was toast, so she needed some time to set it up again. Besides repairing the damage to the camp, we also spent some time healing before returning to bed. We collected the [[boars]]' bristles, hides, bones, and enough meat for 100 meals per [[Boars|boar]].
