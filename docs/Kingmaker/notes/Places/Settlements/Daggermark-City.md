# Daggermark
The largest city in all of the River Kingdoms, Daggermark has maintained enough political and economic stability to secure an abundant supply of food, a rarity in the chaotic Broken Lands region of northeastern Avistan. Daggermark is so stable that it even has a thriving industry and is wealthy enough to mint its own currency. The main reason for this stability are the two guilds for which the city is so famous: the Daggermark Assassins' Guild and the Daggermark Poisoners' Guild. These two organizations often work hand in hand, as the assassins favor the use of poisons, believing that only amateurs leave behind an obvious cause of death. Few bandit lords would be stupid enough to attack Daggermark for fear of being found poisoned, strangled, or having succumbed to some other seemingly "accidental" death
