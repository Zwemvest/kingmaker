# Brunderton
The mining town of Brunderton in eastern Rostland in Brevoy is home to a relatively large number of dwarves for the region. Most dwarves throughout southern Brevoy and the northern River Kingdoms have relatives from here, and gem and ore traders from Brunderton can often be found peddling their wares along the Sellen's many tributaries.
