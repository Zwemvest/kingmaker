# Daggermark
The largest and most stable of the River Kingdoms, Daggermark is renowned for its sister guilds of assassins and poisoners. It also hosts the annual Outlaw Council, where the leaders of the various kingdoms gather to plan the means by which they protect their freedom from the larger forces arrayed against them. This is the closest that the River Kingdoms come to having a unified government, and every year’s session is contentious.    

Even if someone were foolish enough to risk the wrath of its assassins, Daggermark is still far from undefended. It has the largest army in all the River Kingdoms and the city itself boasts both an inner and outer wall.

The most powerful and prestigious members of Daggermark society live within the city's inner wall (known as Dagger Keep), including the ruler, Martro Livondar.
