# Half-orc
As seen by civilized races, half-[[Orc|orcs]] are monstrosities, the result of perversion and violence—whether or not this is actually true. Half-[[Orc|orcs]] are rarely the result of loving unions, and as such are usually forced to grow up hard and fast, constantly fighting for protection or to make names for themselves. Half-[[Orc|orcs]] as a whole resent this treatment, and rather than play the part of the victim, they tend to lash out, unknowingly confirming the biases of those around them. A few feared, distrusted, and spat-upon half-[[Orc|orcs]] manage to surprise their detractors with great deeds and unexpected wisdom—though sometimes it's easier just to crack a few skulls. Some half-[[Orc|orcs]] spend their entire lives proving to full-blooded [[Orc|orcs]] that they are just as fierce. Others opt for trying to blend into [[human]] society, constantly demonstrating that they aren't monsters. Their need to always prove themselves worthy encourages half-[[Orc|orcs]] to strive for power and greatness within the society around them.  

A half-[[orc]] is the offspring of a [[human]] and an [[orc]], or of two half-[[Orc|orcs]]. Because some intolerant people see [[Orc|orcs]] as more akin to monsters than people, they sometimes hate and fear half-[[Orc|orcs]] simply due to their lineage. This commonly pushes half-[[Orc|orcs]] to the margins of society, where some find work in manual labor or as mercenaries, and others fall into crime or cruelty. Many who can’t stand the indignities heaped on them in [[human]] society find a home among their [[orc]] kin or trek into the wilderness to live in peace, apart from society’s judgment.

[[Human|Humans]] often assume half-[[Orc|orcs]] are unintelligent or uncivilized, and half-[[Orc|orcs]] rarely find acceptance among societies with many such folk. To an [[orc]] tribe, a half-[[orc]] is considered smart enough to make a good war leader but weaker physically than other [[Orc|orcs]]. Many half-[[Orc|orcs]] thus end up having low status among [[orc]] tribes unless they can prove their strength.

A half-[[orc]] has a shorter lifespan than other [[Human|humans]], living to be roughly 70 years old.

## In the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]]
Throughout the civilized world, half-[[Orc|orcs]] suffer ostracism and prejudice, yet many find Brevoy not merely tolerant of their kind, but in fact refreshingly accepting. [[Brevoy|Brevans]] don’t view half-[[Orc|orcs]] with the same disdain that the half-breeds receive in other parts of the world, and any half-[[orc]] who adheres to the strict, provincial customs of the land achieves the same level of acceptance that a similarly compliant full-blooded [[human]] would. Half-[[Orc|orcs]] blessed with less overtly bestial features might attempt to pass for [[human]], keeping the unseemly conditions of their birth a closely guarded the secret and leaving their past behind as they start again with a clean slate in Brevoy or the wild [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]]. Some embrace their heritage, however, and are rewarded; warlords among feuding city- states often recruit half-[[Orc|orcs]] to serve as elite soldiers, officers, and law enforcement, valuing their blend of strength and cunning.
## Physical Description
Half-[[Orc|orcs]] average around 6 feet tall, with powerful builds and greenish or grayish skin. Their canine teeth often grow long enough to protrude from their mouths, and these "tusks," combined with heavy brows and slightly pointed ears, give them their notoriously bestial appearance. While half-[[Orc|orcs]] may be impressive, few ever describe them as beautiful. Despite these obvious [[orc]] traits, half-[[Orc|orcs]] are as varied as their [[human]] parents.  

## Society
Unlike [[Half-elf|half-elves]], where at least part of society's discrimination is born out of jealousy or attraction, half-[[Orc|orcs]] get the worst of both worlds: physically weaker than their [[orc]] kin, they also tend to be feared or attacked outright by [[Human|humans]] who don't bother making the distinction between full [[Orc|orcs]] and halfbloods. Even on the best of terms, half-[[Orc|orcs]] in civilized societies are not exactly accepted, and tend to be valued only for their physical abilities. On the other hand, [[orc]] leaders have been known to deliberately spawn half-[[Orc|orcs]], as the halfbreeds make up for their lack of physical strength with increased cunning and aggression, making them natural leaders and strategic advisors.  

Within [[orc]] tribes, half-[[Orc|orcs]] find themselves constantly striving to prove their worth in battle and with feats of strength. Half-[[Orc|orcs]] raised within [[orc]] tribes are more likely to file their tusks and cover themselves in tribal tattoos. Tribal leaders quietly recognize that half-[[Orc|orcs]] are often more clever than their [[orc]] cousins and often apprentice them to the tribe's shaman, where their cunning might eventually strengthen the tribe. Apprenticeship to a shaman is a brutal and often short-lived distinction, however, and those half-[[Orc|orcs]] who survive it either become influential in the tribe or are eventually driven to leave.  

Half-[[Orc|orcs]] have a much more mixed experience in [[human]] society, where many cultures view them as little more than monsters. They often are unable even to get normal work, and are pressed into service in the military or sold into slavery. In these cultures, half-[[Orc|orcs]] often lead furtive lives, hiding their nature whenever possible. The dark underworld of society is often the most welcoming place, and many half-[[Orc|orcs]] wind up serving as enforcers for thieves guilds or other types of organized crime.  

Less commonly, [[human]] cities may allow half-[[Orc|orcs]] a more normal existence, even enabling them to develop small communities of their own. These communities are usually centered around the arena districts, the military, or mercenary organizations where their brute strength is valued and their appearance is more likely to be overlooked. Even surrounded by their own kind, half-[[orc]] life isn't easy. Bullying and physical confrontation comes easy to a people who have been raised with few other examples of behavior. It is, however, one of the best places for young half-[[Orc|orcs]] to grow up without prejudice, and these small enclaves are one of the few places where half-[[orc]] marriages and children are truly accepted and sometimes cherished.  

Even more rarely, certain [[human]] cultures come to embrace half-[[Orc|orcs]] for their strength. There are stories of places where people see half-[[orc]] children as a blessing and seek out half-[[orc]] or [[orc]] lovers. In these cultures, half-[[Orc|orcs]] lead lives not much different from full-blooded [[Human|humans]].
