# Elf
As an ancient people, [elves](https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx?ID=2) have seen great change and have the perspective that can come only from watching the arc of history. After leaving the world in ancient times, they returned to a changed land, and they still struggle to reclaim their ancestral homes, most notably from terrible demons that have invaded parts of their lands. To some, the elves are objects of awe—graceful and beautiful, with immense talent and knowledge. Among themselves, however, the elves place far more importance on personal freedom than on living up to these ideals.

Elves combine otherworldly grace, sharp intellect, and mysterious charm in a way that is practically magnetic to members of other ancestries. They are often voraciously intellectual, though their studies delve into a level of detail that most shorter-lived peoples find excessive or inefficient. Valuing kindness and beauty, elves ever strive to improve their manners, appearance, and culture.

Elves are often rather private people, steeped in the secrets of their groves and kinship groups. They’re slow to build friendships outside their kinsfolk, but for a specific reason: they subtly and deeply attune to their environment and their companions. There’s a physical element to this attunement, but it isn’t only superficial. Elves who spend their lives among [shorter‑lived peoples](Human) often develop a skewed perception of their own mortality and tend to become morose after watching generation after generation of companions age and die. These elves are called the [[Forlorn]].
# In the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]]
Full-blooded elves are rare in [[Brevoy]], generally preferring to live in [[Kyonin|Kyonin]] further to the south. A fair number of rebellious elves, however, emigrate from their homeland up the [[Sellen-River|Sellen River]] to [[Brevoy]]. Often, [[Forlorn|Forlorn]] elves pass through [[Brevoy|Brevoy]] on their way south to [[Kyonin|Kyonin]] to live among their people, and some find the region so amenable that they never complete their journey—although lately, others have chosen to stay after the direct route down the river through the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]] was closed because of hostility from [[bandits]] and indigenous tribes of boggards, [[lizardfolk]], and even trolls. The [[Brevoy|Brevic]] city of [[Restov|Restov]] boasts one of the largest concentrations of elves in the region. Long ago, the elves maintained a stronger presence in this region, and rumors of surviving elven ruins scattered throughout the most remote reaches of the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]] have long intrigued elven scholars and historians.
## Notes
[[Kairos]] is an Elf. 
## Physical Description
While generally taller than [[Human|humans]], elves possess a fragile grace, accentuated by long features and sharply pointed ears. Their eyes are wide and almond-shaped, featuring large and vibrant-colored pupils that make up the entire visible portion of the eye. These pupils give them an alien look and allow them to see sharply even in very little light.

Elves gradually adapt to their environment and their companions, and they often take on physical traits reflecting their surroundings. An elf who has dwelled in primeval forests for centuries, for example, might exhibit verdant hair and gnarled fingers, while one who’s lived in a desert might have golden pupils and skin. Elven fashion, like the elves themselves, tends to reflect their surroundings. Elves living in the forests and other wilderness locales wear clothing that plays off the terrain and flora of their homes, while those who live in cities tend to wear the latest fashions.

Elves reach physical adulthood around the age of 20, though they aren’t considered to be fully emotionally mature by other elves until closer to the passing of their first century, once they’ve experienced more, held several occupations, and outlived a generation of shorter-lived people. A typical elf can live to around 600 years old.

## Society
Elven culture is deep, rich, and on the decline. Their society peaked millennia ago, long before they fled the world to escape a great calamity. They've since returned, but rebuilding is no easy task. Their inborn patience and intellectual curiosity make elves excellent sages, philosophers, and wizards, and their societies are built upon their inherent sense of wonder and knowledge. Elven architecture displays their deep appreciation of beauty, and elven cities are wondrous works of art.

Elves hold deeply seated ideals of individualism, allowing each elf to explore multiple occupations before alighting on a particular pursuit or passion that suits her best. Elves bear notorious grudges against rivals, which the elves call _ilduliel_, but these antagonistic relationships can sometimes blossom into friendships over time.
