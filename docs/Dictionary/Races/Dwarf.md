# Dwarf
[Dwarves](https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx?ID=1)  have a well-earned reputation as a stoic and stern people, ensconced within citadels and cities carved from solid rock. While some see them as dour and humorless crafters of stone and metal, dwarves and those who have spent time among them understand their unbridled zeal for their work, caring far more about quality than quantity. To a stranger, they can seem untrusting and clannish, but to their friends and family, they are warm and caring, their halls filled with the sounds of laughter and hammers hitting anvils.

Dwarves are slow to trust those outside their kin, but this wariness is not without reason. Dwarves have a long history of forced exile from ancestral holds and struggles against the depredations of savage foes, especially giants, goblinoids, [[Orc|orcs]], and the horrors that dwell deep below the surface. While trust from a dwarf is hard-won, once gained it is as strong as iron.
# In the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]]
Though typically rare in northeastern [[Avistan]], dwarves exist in small numbers in almost every community in [[Brevoy]]. Many serve as town blacksmiths, masons, militia quartermasters, or pawnbrokers. The small mining village of [[Brunderton]] in eastern [[Rostland|Rostland]] has an overwhelming dwarven citizenry—most dwarves in the region can claim at least one relative or acquaintance that calls the hamlet home—and gem and ore traders from [[Brunderton]] travel throughout the area peddling their wares. Rumors of untapped or unclaimed mines hidden throughout the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]] are enough to get most dwarves interested in exploring the wilderness.

## Physical Description
Dwarves are short and stocky, standing about a foot shorter than most [[Human|humans]]. They have wide, compact bodies and burly frames. Dwarves of all genders pride themselves on the length of their hair, which they often braid into intricate patterns, some of which represent specific clans. A long beard is a sign of masculinity and honor among the dwarves, and thus a clean-shaven male dwarf is considered weak, untrustworthy, or worse.

Dwarves typically reach physical adulthood around the age of 25, though their traditionalist culture places more value on completing coming of age ceremonies unique to each clan than reaching a certain age. A typical dwarf can live to around 350 years old.

## Society
The ancient surface empire the dwarves once ruled fell long ago, overwhelmed by [[orc]] and goblinoid enemies. Today's dwarves today retain many of the qualities that propelled their people to greatness in ancient times: fierceness, gumption, and stubbornness in endeavors ranging from battle and craftsmanship to forging ties with family and friends.

While the distance between their mountain Sky Citadels can create vast cultural divides between various dwarf clans, most dwarven societies share a number of similarities. Nearly all dwarven peoples share a passion for stonework, metalwork, and gem-cutting. Most are highly skilled at architecture and mining, and many share a hatred of giants, [[Orc|orcs]], and goblinoids.

Few dwarves are seen without their clan dagger strapped to their belt. This dagger is forged just before a dwarf's birth and bears the gemstone of their clan. A parent uses this dagger to cut the infant's umbilical cord, making it the first weapon to taste their blood.
