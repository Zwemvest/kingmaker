# Half-elf
[[Elf|Elves]] have long drawn the covetous gazes of other races. Their generous lifespans, magical affinity, and inherent grace each contribute to the admiration or bitter envy of their neighbors. Of all their traits, however, none so entrance their [[human]] associates as their beauty. Since the two races first came into contact with each other, [[Human|humans]] have held up [[Elf|elves]] as models of physical perfection, seeing in these fair folk idealized versions of themselves. For their part, many [[Elf|elves]] find [[Human|humans]] attractive despite their comparatively barbaric ways, and are drawn to the passion and impetuosity with which members of the younger race play out their brief lives.  

A [half-elf](https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx?ID=7) is born to an [[elf]] and a [[human]], or to two half-[[Elf|elves]]. The life of a half-[[elf]] can be difficult, often marked by a struggle to fit in. Half-[[Elf|elves]] don’t have their own homeland on [[Golarion]], nor are populations of half-[[Elf|elves]] particularly tied to one another, since they often have very disparate [[human]] and [[Elf|elven]] traditions. Instead, most half-[[Elf|elves]] attempt to find acceptance in either [[human]] or [[Elf|elven]] settlements.

Half-[[Elf|elves]] often appear primarily [[human]], with subtly pointed ears and a taller stature than most full-blooded [[Human|humans]]. Half-[[Elf|elves]] lack the almost alien eyes of their [[elf]] parents, though they do have a natural presence—and often a striking beauty— that leads many to become artists or entertainers. Despite this innate appeal, many half-[[Elf|elves]] have difficulty forming lasting bonds with either [[Human|humans]] or [[Elf|elves]] due to the distance they feel from both peoples as a whole.

Half-[[Elf|elves]] live longer than other [[Human|humans]], often reaching an age around 150 years. This causes some of them to fear friendship and romance with [[Human|humans]], knowing that they’ll likely outlive their companions.

Caught between destiny and derision, half-[[Elf|elves]] often view themselves as the middle children of the world.  

## In the Broken Lands
Often the victims of unfounded stigmatization in communities of primarily [[human]] or [[Elf|elven]] populations, half-[[Elf|elves]] typically find Brevoy a welcoming land. The [[Cheliax|Chelish]] and [[Taldor|Taldan]] upper classes have long exiled their embarrassing—if common—illegitimate half-[[elf]] progeny to the unruly [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]], and as a result, many of the region’s half-[[Elf|elves]] claim some noble heritage (even if such claims aren’t formally recognized). Other half-[[Elf|elven]] settlers in the region are the result of trysts between locals and [[Elf|elves]] from nearby Kyonin. Regardless of their origins, half-[[Elf|elves]] find their adaptable nature well suited to [[Brevoy|Brevic]] life, especially those settlements in which adherence to local custom is of paramount concern. Many half-[[Elf|elves]] rise to positions of power thanks to their ability to roll with political changes and bypass unexpected social impediments.
## Physical Description
Half-[[Elf|elves]] stand taller than [[Human|humans]] but shorter than [[Elf|elves]]. They inherit the lean build and comely features of their [[Elf|elven]] lineage, but their skin color is normally dictated by their [[human]] side. While half-[[Elf|elves]] retain the pointed ears of [[Elf|elves]], theirs are more rounded and less pronounced. Their eyes tend to be humanlike in shape, but feature an exotic range of colors from amber or violet to emerald green and deep blue. This pattern changes for half-[[Elf|elves]] of drow descent, however. Such [[Elf|elves]] are almost unfailingly marked with the white or silver hair of the drow parent, and more often than not have dusky gray skin that takes on a purplish or bluish tinge in the right light, while their eye color usually favors that of the [[human]] parent.  

## Society
Their lack of a unified homeland and culture forces half-[[Elf|elves]] to remain versatile, able to conform to nearly any environment. While often considered attractive to both races for the same reasons as their parents, half-[[Elf|elves]] rarely fit in with either [[Human|humans]] or [[Elf|elves]], as both races see too much evidence of the other in them. This lack of acceptance weighs heavily on many half-[[Elf|elves]], yet others are bolstered by their unique status, seeing in their lack of a formalized culture the ultimate freedom. As a result, half-[[Elf|elves]] are incredibly adaptable, capable of adjusting their mind-sets and talents to whatever societies they find themselves in.  

Even half-[[Elf|elves]] welcomed by one side of their heritage often find themselves caught between cultures, as they are encouraged, cajoled, or even forced into taking on diplomatic responsibilities between [[human]] and [[Elf|elven]] kind. Many half-[[Elf|elves]] rise to the occasion of such service, seeing it as a chance to prove their worth to both races. Others, however, come to resent the pressures and presumptions foisted upon them by both races and turn any opportunity to broker power, make peace, or advance trade between [[Human|humans]] and [[Elf|elves]] into an exercise in personal profit.
