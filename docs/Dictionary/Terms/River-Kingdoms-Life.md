# Life in the River Kingdoms
Passing crusaders headed to Mendev complain of the chaos in the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]], but this is hyperbole. Far removed from the horror of the Worldwound, the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]] are as predictable as a cauldron—you never know what will come bubbling up, but you can be sure the whole thing is hot. This heat makes the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]] a singular place to live. The [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]] are split into more than two dozen sovereign realms, ruled by despots of varying temperament. Tyrants who raise a keep in the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]] often hail from surrounding lands, but are almost always castoffs, criminals, or wayward offspring of more important folk. Most rule by force, though some are gentler than others. Life in the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]] is harsh. Bandits can attack at any time, local governments shift like riverbanks, invading armies pillage the land, and unexpected monstrous and magical threats occur with alarming frequency. Every family has lost someone to sudden violence. The perilous uncertainty keeps everyone tense, suspicious, and often angry. Trust is paramount. Anyone unrecognizable is not just a potential threat, but also a potential vanguard for an army of threats. “Trust costs more than money” is a common [[River-Kingdoms|Riverfolk]] aphorism.

For all this danger, though, the land is still beautiful and bountiful. Even the marshes and forests are fertile. Raiders, not the land or weather, make farming hard. Wheat, corn, oats, and rice are quick and plentiful crops grown throughout the kingdoms. Livestock grow fat on the rich grasses fed by the hydra-headed tributaries of the [[Sellen-River|Sellen River]].

[[River-Kingdoms|Riverfolk]] love politics, and talk about it in the same manner as farmers talk weather: maybe they can’t do anything about it, but they discuss it endlessly. Any given [[River-Kingdoms|Riverfolk]] has an opinion about which form of government is best, how the local leader is doing, and how all the neighboring kingdoms’ leaders are doing.

Living in the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]] requires protection. Farms and livestock pens are small and well defended, as though each were a small fortress. Moats and earthworks surround the better-established ones, and most farms also have a defendable cellar into which farmers and their families can retreat. Even hamlets and thorps have their own stockade walls, and most commoners wear weapons openly, “to keep everyone honest.”

Trades that require complex support, such as alchemy, are rare and short-lived. Functional, relatively mobile livelihoods thrive here, including tanning, herding, brewing, and other forms of craftsmanship.
