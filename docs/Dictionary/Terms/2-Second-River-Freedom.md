# Oathbreakers Die (Second River Freedom)
The flip side of free speech in the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]] is the gravity of oath-breaking. Petty liars are common, but in a land where tomorrow can bring a gang of mercenaries, the people in charge must know whom they can trust. Common oaths include “I swear by the [[Sellen-River|Sellen]],” “May [[Hanspur]] take my sons,” and “My freedom is my bond.”

[[River-Kingdoms|Riverfolk]] who undertake oaths of this nature keep them, or die trying. This attitude trickles down to business transactions, but can ironically make things more difficult— it’s hard to get a [[River-Kingdoms|Riverfolk]] trader to fully commit to anything. Standard contracts contain a “[[Gyronna]] clause” which voids a contract in case of unforeseen calamity. This would seem a perfect dodge for scoundrels, but associating with [[Gyronna|Gyronna]] is the worst omen a [[River-Kingdoms|Riverfolk]] trader can invoke. No one deals with a trader who admits affliction by [[Gyronna]], lest the association rub off.
