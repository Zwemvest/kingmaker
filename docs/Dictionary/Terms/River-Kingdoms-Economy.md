# Economy in the River Kingdoms
In most countries, food producers are at the bottom of the pecking order. Large nations need tons of food to feed their populace. Not so in the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]], where smaller, scattered populations require less food, and a willingness to take charge of crops or livestock is practically an act of def iance. Able farmers and herders earn respect for daring to do their jobs. Indeed, food suppliers are local heroes, and wise lords court their involvement, especially since the Third [[River-Freedoms|River Freedom]] makes standard feudalism impossible. Mistreated farmers or herders can leave and receive a hero’s welcome a day’s walk away if they’re willing to contribute their skills to that community. This makes farming and ranching among the noblest professions among [[River-Kingdoms|Riverfolk]], the work of the courageous few who feed their families and safeguard communities against raiders and the hazards of nature.

Soldiers are the other laurelled professionals in the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]]. A lord may have only a few dozen loyal soldiers, with the rest of his military made up of mercenaries. Anyone can carry a spear, but a soldier trained with weapons, steeled to battle, and devoted to a king is worth more than his or her salary. Few kingdoms bother to differentiate between military and city watch—soldiers handle both roles. An experienced, loyal soldier is respected by local [[River-Kingdoms|Riverfolk]] as a guardian. This appreciation has a bolstering effect on soldiers who guard a kingdom. Some remain tied to the people of the land, and accept new lords as they come and go as long as the common people are treated well; others prefer to find a more compatible liege in another kingdom when the local ruler changes.
