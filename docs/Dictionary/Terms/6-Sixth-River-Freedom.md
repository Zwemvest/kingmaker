# You Have What You Hold (Sixth River Freedom)
In contrast to many other civilizations on [[Golarion]], this freedom draws a moral distinction between robbery and mere stealing. Taking something by force is considered acceptable, even begrudgingly praiseworthy. Burglary, on the other hand, is punishable under common law. The difference is in allowing a victim the ability to resist, the opportunity to face his or her robber, and to plan for repossession if so desired. This allows for a rough honesty, letting [[River-Kingdoms|Riverfolk]] know and face their enemies.
