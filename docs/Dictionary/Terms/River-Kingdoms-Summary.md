[[Lambreth]] is a dictatorial confederation of the three cities of [[Maashinelle]], [[Lockridge]], and [[Sezgin]]. The realm is ruled with an iron fist by the powerful [[Kamdyn-Arnefax|Lord Arnefax]], and crimes are nearly non-existent due to the harsh punishments he unleaseses on criminals.

The [[Pitax-Realm|Kingdom of Pitax]] in [[Pathfinder-Society|Pathfinder]] is a realm of thieves, where King [[Castruccio-Irovetti|Castruccio Irovetti]] holds strong control over all forms of art.
