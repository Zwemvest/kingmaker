### [[Lambreth]]
[[Lambreth]] is a dictatorial confederation of the three cities of [[Maashinelle]], [[Lockridge]], and [[Sezgin]]. The realm is ruled with an iron fist by the powerful [[Kamdyn-Arnefax|Lord Arnefax]], and crimes are nearly non-existent due to the harsh punishments he unleashes on criminals.
