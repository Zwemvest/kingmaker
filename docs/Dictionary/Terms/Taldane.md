# Taldane
Taldane is the most widely spoken language in [[Avistan]] and Garund; indeed, it is often referred to as Common across the [[Inner-Sea|Inner Sea]] region. It is a trade language which takes its alphabet from ancient Jistka and its numerals from Kelish. Most of the terms and grammar are based on ancient Azlanti, although Taldane also borrows from [[Varisia|Varisian]].

It is thought to be one of the oldest [[human]] languages still spoken in the [[Inner-Sea|Inner Sea]] region, and is certainly the most widely spoken. Many localities in [[Avistan]] have their own particular slang words or phrases, and the most well-known of these is Korvosan slang.

Taldane is also spoken in the north and west of the continent of [[Tian-Xia|Tian Xia]] by those who trade heavily with the [[Inner-Sea|Inner Sea]] region. It is also the national tongue of the [[Taldor|Taldan]] colony of Amanandar there, and is beginning to spread to other countries in that region.
