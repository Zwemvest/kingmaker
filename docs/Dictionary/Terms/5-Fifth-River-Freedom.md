# Slavery is an Abomination (Fifth River Freedom)
Nothing is so secure in the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]] as freedom for escaped slaves. Unlike Andorens, [[River-Kingdoms|Riverfolk]] won’t leave their homes to free slaves, but a runaway in the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]] is a slave no more.

Some estimates say that one-third of the [[River-Kingdoms|Riverfolk]] alive today are escaped slaves or descendants of slaves. [[River-Kingdoms|Riverfolk]] welcome thousands of escaped slaves to all kingdoms each year, to fill ranks in armies and agriculture. Escaped slaves are usually the fiercest proponents of the [[River-Freedoms|River Freedoms]], as these conventions are the first taste of freedom in their new lives. A slave that escapes to the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]] is considered truly free. 

Because of this freedom, Hellknights of the Order of the Chain and other slave-takers cannot operate openly here, going so far as being barred to hold office, and any [[Andoran|Andoren]] [[Eagle-Knights|Eagle Knight]] can dispel most [[River-Kingdoms|Riverfolk]]’s natural distrust of strangers by showing her insignia—and get a free drink and a barn to sleep in.

Depending on the local custom, this abolition can extend to indentured servitude. Spellcasters are warned to be circumspect when summoning monsters in the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]], lest their magic be misinterpreted.
