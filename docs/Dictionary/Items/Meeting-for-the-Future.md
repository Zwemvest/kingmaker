# Meeting for the Future
"Meeting for the Future" is a book written by the bard [[Djames]], chronicling the [[Party|party]]'s [[../Events/The-expedition-for-the-Stolen-Lands.md|expedition]] for the future of a kingdom plagued by strife and lawlessness in the [[../../Places/River-Kingdoms/Stolen-Lands.md|Stolen Lands]]. 

The books starts at the [[../Events/Grand-Banquet-at-Aldori-Manor.md|Grand Banquet]], where it introduces four commanders tasked with leading the charge for change in the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]]: [[../../Creatures/Party-Members/Leonardo.md|Sir Leonardo Lebeda]], [[../../Creatures/Party-Members/Djames.md|Djames Sailor]], [[../../Creatures/Party-Members/Kairos.md|Lady Kairos]], and [[../../Creatures/Party-Members/Lizzy-the-Leshby.md|Lady Lizziona Leshby]]. It describes unbelievable acts of bravery from unlikely heroes like the young storyteller [[Linzi]] and Lady Lizziona Leshby, who manages to sway a frost giant to join their cause through her connection to nature.

Overall, "Meeting for the Future" portrays an very vivid story of courage, resilience, and the power of unity in the face of adversity, but is written in such overly colourful narration that it may be bordering on the unbelievable.
