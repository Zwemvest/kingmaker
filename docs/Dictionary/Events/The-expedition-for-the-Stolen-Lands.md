# Expedition for the Stolen Lands
An expedition from [[Brevoy]] to the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]] begins on [[Session-0#24 Calistril 4710|24 Calistril 4710]], with a [[Grand-Banquet-at-Aldori-Manor|Grand Banquet]] at [[Aldori-Manor|Aldori Manor]] organized by [[Jamandi-Aldori|Lady Jamandi]] and [[Ioseph-Sellemius|Ioseph Sellemius]]. The expedition sent several different groups into the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]] from [[Brevoy]], ostensibly in the name of [[Noleski-Surtova|King Surtova]] with the aid of the [[Aldori-Swordlords|Aldori Swordlords]].

The [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]], located within the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]], has been plagued by monsters, [[bandits]], and other threats, making it virtually uninhabitable. However, with the backing of [[Jamandi-Aldori|Lady Jamandi]] Aldori and the support of the [[Aldori-Swordlords|Aldori Swordlords]], adventurers are called upon to settle the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]] and establish order where chaos reigns. The ultimate goal of the expedition is to bring stability to the region, establish new territories, and earn recognition and rewards for their efforts from the rulers of [[Brevoy]].

Among the guests where [[Amiri]], [[Harrim]], [[Valerie]], [[Linzi]], [[Jaethal]], the [[Iron-Wraiths|Iron Wraiths]],  [[Maegar-Varn|Maegar Varn]] and [[Hannis-Drelev|Hannis Drelev]]. 

Our own [[Party|expedition group]] consisted of [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] and [[Gomi]], [[Djames]], [[Leonardo|Leonardo]], and [[Kairos]] and [[Missy]].
