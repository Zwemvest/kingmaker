# Bandit attack on Oleg's Trading Post
Originally, [[Oleg-Leveton|Oleg]] and [[Svetlana-Leveton|Svetlana]] had founded the trading post in an old abandoned border fort at the southern edge of [[Rostland]] with the help of a contingent of soldiers who assisted in rebuilding. The soldiers, however, were called back to [[Brevoy]] in the month of Lamashan. A relief contingent was supposed to arrive by the month of Kuthona, but an early winter kept them sheltered in [[Restov]]. 

This situation led to [[Olegs-Trading-Post|Oleg's Trading Post]] being vulnerable to recurring [[Bandits|bandit]] attacks demanding "taxes" from [[Oleg-Leveton|Oleg]] and [[Svetlana-Leveton|Svetlana]]. These [[bandits]] had been returning every month on the first of the month, at the earliest hour of dawn. During the first attack, they arrived with fourteen [[bandits]], but their numbers would quickly dwindle during the later winter. [[Jamandi-Aldori|Jamandi Aldori]] knew of the situation and asked the party to check up on [[Oleg-Leveton|Oleg]] and [[Svetlana-Leveton|Svetlana]] and see what they could do to help. 

Before the expected return of the [[bandits]] on the 1st of Pharast 4710, the party had strategically prepared Spike Traps and other defenses around the trading post. When the [[bandits]] arrived, the traps proved highly effective, incapacitating several [[bandits]] and leading to the capture of [[Happs-Bydon|Happs Bydon]]. Despite Happs' defiance during interrogation, the party remained resolute, extracting valuable information about their adversaries and preparing to confront the [[Bandits|bandit]] leader, [[Kressle]].
