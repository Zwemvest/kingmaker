# Liberation of the Moon Radish Patch
[[Oleg-Leveton|Oleg]] has been under a lot of stress lately, and [[Svetlana-Leveton|Svetlana]] would love to cook him his favourite meal-moon radish soup-to help him relax. [[Svetlana-Leveton|Svetlana]] knows the closest moon radish patch grows about 16 miles south of the trading post, but she hasn't been able to visit the site in months.

On [[Session-3#3 Pharast 4710|3 Pharast 4710]], we tracked down the [[Moon-Radish|Moon Radish]] patch, and found that it was taken over by Kobolds. We defeated the kobolds so that we could bring back several of the Moon Radishes to [[Svetlana-Leveton|Svetlana]].
