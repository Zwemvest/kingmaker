# Capture of Kressle
On [[Session-3#2 Pharast 4710|2 Pharast 4710]], the [[Bandits|bandit]] lieutenant [[Kressle]] was captured.  

The capture of [[Kressle]] was a party effort to capture one of the [[Stag-Lord-Bandits|Stag Lord Bandits]]' main lieutenants. The location of [[Kressle]]'s [[Bandits|bandit]] camp had been told to the party by [[Happs-Bydon|Happs Bydon]].

The capture of [[Kressle]] was a testament to dedicated strategic planning and tactical coordination. The group discovered the location of [[Kressle]]'s [[Bandits|bandit]] camp through the tracking of [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]], with the help of [[Djames]]. The party devised a multifaceted plan to assault the camp, utilizing a mix of deception, magic, and brute force.

[[Djames]] approached the [[Bandits|bandit]] camp under the guise of a wine trader, successfully gaining the [[bandits]]' trust and securing an invitation to join them. This distraction allowed [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] to cast a Sleep spell, which incapacitated [[Kressle]] and one of her lackeys.

Simultaneously, [[Kairos]] climbed to a vantage point and eliminated a lookout with a powerful Spellstrike. Another [[Bandits|bandit]] attempted to flee and trigger an alarm but was swiftly intercepted and killed by [[Leonardo]] using an Athletic Rush.

With the immediate threats neutralized, the group secured the camp. [[Leonardo]] and [[Djames]] used their combined magical abilities to subdue the remaining [[bandits]]. Their efforts culminated in the capture of [[Kressle]] and two other [[bandits]], significantly weakening the [[Stag-Lord|Stag Lord]]'s hold on the region.
