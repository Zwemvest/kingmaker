# Outlaw Council
The Outlaw Council is an annual meeting held in the city of Daggermark where the most powerful leaders of the River Kingdoms come together to discuss threats to their collective freedoms and security. This is the closest the River Kingdoms get to having a single government, but every year it is quite contentious.

The rulers of all the kingdoms are entitled to attend, but most weight is given to the leaders of the more established regions, currently Daggermark, Gralton, Lambreth, Mivon, Pitax, the Protectorate of the Black Marquis, Sevenarches, Tymon, and Uringen. A lord must attend personally in order to have a voice in the proceedings; proxies are not allowed to address the council. The meeting grounds are considered to be neutral territory.
## History
The council was first suggested by the Daggermark Assassins' Guild and the Poisoners' Guild over ninety years ago following the upheaval caused by the sudden death of the last king of Daggermark. The guilds sent emissaries to the other River Kingdoms who suggested a council be established to address issues affecting all the Kingdoms. The other regions agreed, and the following the year the Outlaw Council, as it was dubbed, met in Daggermark. Its first act was to officially codify the River Freedoms.

Since then, the Council has continued to meet each year in Daggermark, where the meeting hall is considered to be neutral territory.
