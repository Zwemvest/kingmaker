# Attack on Lady Jamandi Aldori's Manor
During the night of [[Session-0#25 Calistril 4710|25 Calistril 1470]], after a banquet to celebrate the start of the [[The-expedition-for-the-Stolen-Lands|Expedition for the Stolen Lands]], [[Aldori-Manor|Aldori Manor]] was attacked by a group of assailants who infiltrated the premises. The attackers breached the threshold during the night, attempting silent assassinations in several of the guest rooms and bringing [[Giants#Frost Giants|Frost Giant]]s into [[Aldori-Manor|Aldori Manor]]. However, a yell from a guard woke up the party before they too could be targeted. 

Though the party quickly rid [[Aldori-Manor|Aldori Manor]] of the assassins, the assailants had already managed to inflict some damage, murdering several guests and guards. 

A single Frost Giant had managed to corner [[Linzi]] before the party could slay the [[Giants#Frost Giants|Frost Giant]] and rescue [[Linzi]].

A different Frost Giant knocked out [[Harrim]], [[Valerie]], and [[Amiri]], but was wounded in the process. [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] healed everyone and negotatiated with the [[Giants#Frost Giants|Frost Giant]] to leave [[Aldori-Manor|Aldori Manor]] and never return. [[Amiri]] was not fond of this. 

The party then returned to the great hall of the manor, which was fully barricaded by Captain [[Ivenzi]] and his guards in the aftermath of a brutal attack, and because there seemed to be smoke coming from the western wing of [[Aldori-Manor|Aldori Manor]]. 

[[Ivenzi]] informs the party of the dire situation: mercenaries and giants have infiltrated the manor, forcing guards to gather in the grand hall while [[Jamandi-Aldori|Lady Jamandi Aldori]] leads the effort to clear the rest of the building. Smoke billows from closed doors, hinting at fires raging within. 

[[Djames]] crafts makeshift gas masks from soaked cloth to mitigate the effects of smoke inhalation, while [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]]'s magical abilities prove instrumental in clearing the smoke-filled corridors.

As the smoke dissipates, the party divides to investigate the bedrooms adjacent to the corridor. [[Kairos]] discovers a room containing an armored statue depicting the deity [[Milani]], while [[Djames]] and [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] contend with flames in another chamber. [[Leonardo]] faces an inferno in yet another room but swiftly takes action to extinguish the blaze. 

The party later finds an unconscious [[Tartuccio]], who would later hurt [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]]'s feelings when she tries to help [[Tartuccio]]. The party also fights off multiple [[bandits]] who had kidnapped [[Jaethal]]. The party then moved to the trophy room, from which they scouted the dueling arena.

Upon entering the chaos in the dueling arena, [[Jamandi-Aldori|Lady Jamandi Aldori]]'s voice cuts through the tumult, directing the party's attention to a formidable figure among the assailants, later revealed to be [[Volodmyra]], the leader of the notorious [[Black-Tears|Black Tears]]. [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] takes initiative with a crackling Electric Arc, while [[Djames]] employs a Command spell to disrupt a Frost Giant's attack. [[Jamandi-Aldori|Lady Jamandi]] showcases her prowess by severing a Frost Giant's arm, and [[Leonardo]] dispatches an assailant with a powerful strike. [[Kairos]] erects a protective Shield spell and unleashes a devastating Spellstrike, supported by [[Djames]]'s inspiring anthem. With their combined efforts, they swiftly dispatch the last of the [[Black-Tears|Black Tears]] in [[Aldori-Manor|Aldori Manor]].

[[Jamandi-Aldori|Lady Jamandi]] expresses her gratitude to the party for their defense of the manor, and the party returns the safeguarded guard wages to her. As a token of appreciation, [[Jamandi-Aldori|Lady Jamandi]] generously distributes rewards to each member, including healing potions and gold coins, recognizing their valorous efforts and dedication to the cause of safeguarding House Aldori and the stability of the region.

In the morning, [[Jamandi-Aldori|Lady Aldori]] would formally sent out four different parties with a charter into the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]]
