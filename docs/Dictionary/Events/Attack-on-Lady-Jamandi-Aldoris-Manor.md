# Attack on Lady Jamandi Aldori's Manor
During the night of [[Session-0#25 Calistril 4710|25 Calistril 1470]], after a banquet to celebrate the start of the [[The-expedition-for-the-Stolen-Lands|Expedition for the Stolen Lands]], [[Aldori-Manor|Aldori Manor]] was attacked by a group of assailants who infiltrated the premises. The attackers breached the threshold during the night, attempting silent assassinations in several of the guest rooms and bringing [[Giants#Frost Giants|Frost Giant]]s into [[Aldori-Manor|Aldori Manor]]. However, a yell from a guard woke up the party before they too could be targeted. 

Though the party quickly rid [[Aldori-Manor|Aldori Manor]] of the assassins, the assailants had already managed to inflict some damage, murdering several guests and guards. 

A single Frost Giant had managed to corner [[Linzi]] before the party could slay the [[Giants#Frost Giants|Frost Giant]] and rescue [[Linzi]].

A different Frost Giant knocked out [[Harrim]], [[Valerie]], and [[Amiri]], but was wounded in the process. [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] healed everyone and negotatiated with the [[Giants#Frost Giants|Frost Giant]] to leave [[Aldori-Manor|Aldori Manor]] and never return. [[Amiri]] was not fond of this.
