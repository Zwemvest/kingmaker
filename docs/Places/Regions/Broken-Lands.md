# Broken Lands
The Broken Lands is the name given to the northeastern region of [[Avistan]] comprising the nations of [[Brevoy|Brevoy]] (itself divided into the distinct areas of [[Rostland|Rostland]] and [[Issia]]), [[Mendev|Mendev]], [[Numeria|Numeria]], [[Razmiran]], the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]], and the [[Sarkoris-Scar|Sarkoris Scar]]. It is a land defined by struggle and scarcity. Its cities lack the prestigious artistic, academic, and cultural institutions found throughout much of the rest of the [[Inner-Sea|Inner Sea]] region. The societies of the Broken Land are often marked by severe inequality that limit social advancement, and its people must often struggle just to survive.

## Geography  
Much of the region's scarcity is caused by its lack of arable land, be it the demon-tainted, broken tors of the [[Sarkoris-Scar|Sarkoris Scar]]; the cold, irradiated and windswept steppes of [[Numeria]]; or the mosquito-infested swamps of the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]]. The little fertile soil there is can be found in southern [[Brevoy]], along parts of the [[Sellen-River|Sellen River]], and in small basins scattered around [[Razmiran]], the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]], [[Mendev|Mendev]], and [[Numeria|Numeria]]. The lack of foodstuffs often supports despotic regimes, such as the one found in [[Razmiran]], where [[Razmir]] rules with near-total dictatorial power.

## People
The most commonly found peoples in the Broken Lands are [[Human|humans]] of [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords|Kellid]] or [[Taldor|Taldan]] extraction, in addition to [[Dwarf|dwarves]]. The most frequently spoken languages are Chthonian, Draconic, [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords|Hallit]], [[Lands-of-the-Linnorm-Kings|Skald]], [[Taldane]], and [[Varisia|Varisian]]. Popular deities worshipped include [[Abadar]], [[Cayden-Cailean|Cayden Cailean]], [[Desna|Desna]], [[Gorum|Gorum]], [[Iomedae]], and [[Lamashtu]].

## Economy  
[[Brevoy]] stands as a prominent exporter of food within the region. [[Rostland|Rostland]] contributes timber, grain, fruit, vegetables, and livestock, whereas [[Issia]] specializes in dried and salted fish, pickled clams, and freshwater pearls. Notably, the peoples of [[Brevoy|Brevoy]] import finished goods, cloth, spices, and books. In contrast, [[Mendev|Mendev]] largely relies on imports for its survival necessities. [[Numeria|Numeria]] exports skymetal, illicit technology fragments, hides, teeth of the enigmatic wasteland creatures, and live, captive specimens, while primarily importing food, alcohol, and jewelry. [[Razmiran]], another key food exporter, also deals in cloth, lumber, and fine woodwork, importing alchemical, herbal, and medicinal supplies.

## Politics
The political history of the Broken Lands is marked by countless calamities and various strongmen who took advantage of it. These calamities include the opening of the Worldwound, the crashing of an immense starship during the Rain of Stars, and the invasion of dragon-enhanced armies from [[Iobaria]] in [[Brevoy]]. Each of these events caused untold decades, centuries, or millennia of suffering.
