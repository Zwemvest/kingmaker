# Elderwoods
This stand of ancient oak trees in the south, near the [[Kyonin]] border, is older than the [[Oakstewards|Oaksteward]] organization, and thick with treants. The [[Oakstewards]] do not allow logging here, regardless of the immense sums of money they have been offered for this virgin, millennia-old timber.
