# Lake Encarthan
Lake Encarthan is one of the largest bodies of water in [[Avistan]] and was once one of its most highly traveled as well. This changed somewhat when Tar-Baphon escaped from his prison of Gallowspire in 4719 AR and relocated to the Isle of Terror in the middle of Lake Encarthan.

The nations of Druma, the Gravelands, [[Kyonin]], Molthune, Nirmathas, [[Razmiran]], and [[Ustalav]] all share the lake's coastline, and the port cities of Caliphas, Kerse, Tamran, and Thronestep each serve as their nation's capital, no doubt bolstered both economically and militarily by their strategic locations on Encarthan's banks.
