# Goldleaf Glade
In the northern part of [[Hymbria]] are two glades, connected by a natural spring and surrounded by ancient trees. This is the primary meeting place for the [[Elf|elves]], where everything from weddings to political meetings to seasonal celebrations takes place. A shrine to [[Desna]] is located in the center of the spring, and [[Elf|elves]] visiting the grove often stop to fill flasks and waterskins with blessed water. Only [[Elf|elves]] are permitted in the glade, and [[Elf|elves]] from outside [[Hymbria]] must be accompanied by a Hymbrian [[elf]] who vouches for his or her conduct.
