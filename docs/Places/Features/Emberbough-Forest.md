# Emberbough Forest
Emberbough Forest is a forest of cinderpine trees whose red and orange flesh and smoke-like pollen clouds give the forest its name. It lies east of the [[Sellen-River|Sellen River]] between Hajoth Hakados and the ruins of [[Heibarr]]. While some forage and trap game within Emberbough Forest and treasure hunters seek lost ruins and [[Emberbough-Cairn|Emberbough Cairn]], few live in or near it due to fears of [[Gyronna]]'s followers.
