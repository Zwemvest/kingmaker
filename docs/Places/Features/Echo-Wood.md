# Echo Wood
Echo Wood is a sizable forest located in north-western [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]] and a region within that large country. It borders the western settlement of [[Mosswater]]. Home to crumbling Azlanti ruins, the woodland is also home to monstrous spiders who are said to be building their nests within the ruins. The woods and its ruins are claimed as the territory of the [[Protectorate-of-the-Black-Marquis|Protectorate of the Black Marquis]], but the forest is mostly ignored by the rulers of the Protectorate. More recently, the small town of [[Thornkeep]] on the western edge of the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]] seems to have made a better claim on the Wood. 

[[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords|Kellid]] raiders are a constant menace, sometimes passing through the woodland in order to raid the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]]. [[Goblin|Goblins]]-remnants of the [[Kingdom-of-Zog|Kingdom of Zog]]-are prevalent in the forest, as well as in the town itself.
