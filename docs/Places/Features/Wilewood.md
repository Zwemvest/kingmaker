# Wilewood
Wilewood is the largest forest in the [[Sevenarches-Realm|River Kingdom of Sevenarches]]. It is inhabited by numerous dangerous [[fey]], arboreals, centaurs and other forest denizens. The [[fey]] think of themselves as a sovereign nation within [[Sevenarches-Realm|Sevenarches]], and are unfriendly to all outsiders. They do not consider themselves strictly aligned with the [[Oakstewards]], but recognize the druids as friends of the Wilewood, working with them despite their chaotic nature. Many animals living in the wood are permanently awakened by [[fey]] magic.

Somewhere within the Wilewood is a great clearing hundreds of feet across. [[Seven-Arches|Seven Arches]] stand in the clearing, carved from gray-brown basalt and arranged according to some arcane pattern. The land around the Wilewood serves as a base for several tribes of marsh giant raiders. They are brazen and sometimes raid as far as [[Riverton]].

The largest forest in Sevenarches contains an unknown number of [[fey]], treants, centaurs, and assorted forest denizens. The Wilewood is not home to any strictly evil creatures, but all are wild and dangerous, especially to those here without [[Oakstewards|Oaksteward]] permission. The wildness of this forest is unlike the manicured woods of [[Kyonin]] or the [[human]]-subdued forests of the [[Inner-Sea|Inner Sea]] region; rumor has it that nearly one in 10 adult animals encountered in the Wilewood are permanently awakened by [[fey]] magic. Though intelligent, few of these beasts tolerate trespassers. The [[fey]] here think of themselves as a sovereign nation within Sevenarches, and are unfriendly to all outsiders at best. Lacking the same ideals or ethics as mortal creatures, the [[fey]] make unauthorized visits dangerous even to those of innocent heart and benign intent. The [[fey]] donâ€™t consider themselves strictly aligned with the [[Oakstewards]], but recognize the druids as friends of the wood, and work with them as their chaotic nature permits.
