# Wilewood
Wilewood is the largest forest in the [[Sevenarches-Realm|River Kingdom of Sevenarches]]. It is inhabited by numerous dangerous [[fey]], arboreals, centaurs and other forest denizens. The [[fey]] think of themselves as a sovereign nation within [[Sevenarches-Realm|Sevenarches]], and are unfriendly to all outsiders. They do not consider themselves strictly aligned with the [[Oakstewards]], but recognize the druids as friends of the Wilewood, working with them despite their chaotic nature. Many animals living in the wood are permanently awakened by [[fey]] magic.

Somewhere within the Wilewood is a great clearing hundreds of feet across. Seven Arches stand in the clearing, carved from gray-brown basalt and arranged according to some arcane pattern.

The land around the Wilewood serves as a base for several tribes of marsh giant raiders. They are brazen and sometimes raid as far as [[Riverton]].
