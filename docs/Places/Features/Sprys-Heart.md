# Spry’s Heart
This especially dark and tangled part of the forest seems to attract evil [[fey]] or corrupt good [[fey]] to wickedness. The grig Mather Nithra lives here in the hollow of a tall, dead tree, counting coins and [[human]] finger bones while he plots ways to make life miserable for the people of [[Uringen-City|Uringen]].
