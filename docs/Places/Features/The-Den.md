# The Den
About 10 years ago, a pack of awakened dire wolves left the [[Wilewood]] and claimed the southeastern corner of Sevenarches. Now, about 20 of them live in an empty stone granary in an abandoned village they call the Den. The wolves speak Sylvan, and attack anyone in their territory without warning, even [[Oakstewards]]. [[Human]] survivors of the wolvesâ€™ appropriation moved north, but many still resent the loss of their homes and personal treasures. Several abandoned villages remain largely intact, as the wolves eat looters but care little for their treasures.
