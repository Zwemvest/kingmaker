# Shrike River
The Shrike River is a tributary to the mighty [[Sellen-River|Sellen River]] that flows through the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]]. The river is named for the numerous flocks of birds that nest along its length.

The river begins high in the Icerime Peaks, the mountains that separate [[Brevoy]] on the continent of [[Avistan]] from the wild land of [[Iobaria]] in Casmaron. From its many smaller tributaries it pools in a large lake in the Hills of Nomen and then flows generally westward past the city of [[Restov]].

From there it turns southwestward through the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]], past the [[Narlmarches]], and into the [[East-Sellen-River|East Sellen River]] at the [[Mivon-City|city of Mivon]].

Although it connects [[Brevoy]] with the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]], it makes for a poor trade route as the waterway is interrupted by two waterfalls, thus making safe travel between the two regions impossible.
