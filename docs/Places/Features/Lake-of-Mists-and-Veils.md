# Lake of Mists and Veils
The Lake of Mists and Veils is a large freshwater lake in northeastern [[Avistan]], bordered by the nations of [[Brevoy]], [[Mendev]], [[Numeria]], and [[Iobaria]]. In [[Brevoy]], people simply call it "the Lake."

The lake is the source of the mighty [[Sellen-River|Sellen River]], and much of the trade and transportation in the region travels along the river, the lake, or both.

The lake's name originates from how, at the onset of winter, the warm water "steams" as the chill of night sets in; the mist burns off in the morning. 

Clouds drift across the Lake year-round and according to some are seen even below the waterline.
