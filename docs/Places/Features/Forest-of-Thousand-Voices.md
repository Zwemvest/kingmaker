# Forest of Thousand Voices
Among the densest wildernesses of the River Kingdoms, the forest of Thousand Voices holds untold varieties of life and an almost equal number of mysteries. Also called the Forest of Breath, it is a strange place, and nearly all who come within sight of the misty old-growth realm of tall beech, white oak, hemlock, and veined orger trees speak of strange lights and whispers that rise and fall through the foliage. While moaning wind and sparkling dew amid the hanging, hag-hair lichen account for a measure of the strange accounts, tales of unexplained disappearances, ghostly beckoners, and winding paths that open and vanish with a glance grant the forest its sinister reputation. Numerous fey beings and fairy-kin are known to linger among the gnarled forest trunks, and while many prove content to merely harass those who intrude upon their woodlands, others prove far less forgiving, especially of those trespassers bearing f lame and steel. Bandit rumors also speak of much stranger things hidden by the forest, like massive but slow dragonsnails, the ancient Trees That Weep, Ghogas the Tick Mother, and the ivy-exploded Castle of Knives. For all its tales of danger and treasure, though, all rumors of the woodland carry with them the same warning: avoid the Forest of Breath, where men are unwelcome.
