# Narlmarches
Splitting the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]] in half, the Narlmarches—or Narlmarch Woods, as they are sometimes known—sprawl across the region’s lowlands, hiding deep ravines, craggy hills, and languid streams beneath its boughs of oak, beech, and rushleaf. Within range proud herds of elk, rivercats (a mossy-furred breed of bobcat), black bears, boars, brush thylacines, and numerous breeds of especially large rodents. More unusual creatures also inhabit the forest, including giant owls, will-o’-wisps, various aggressive plant creatures, and a healthy owlbear population. Several small troll gangs also occupy the forest’s southern reaches near the [[Candlemere|Candlemere]], their seclusion affording them a simple life as hunters and scavengers, though, like most of their kind, they take eager sport in ambushing weaker humanoids. The ruins of numerous forgotten bandit hideaways also molder within the [[Narlmarches|Narlmarches]], leading to countless tales of lost riches and trap-laden tombs of fantastic treasures.

The kingdom of [[Mivon-Realm|Mivon]] at the southern end of the Narlmarches has begin to exploit them for lumber, but a band of [[Elf|elves]] reside in that part of the forest and resist the loggers.
