# Yhalt
The Yhalt River is a tributary of the mighty [[Sellen-River|Sellen River]] that spends its entire length passing through a number of [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]]. It begins high in the eastern [[Branthlend-Mountains|Branthlend Mountains]] in the border region between [[Brevoy]] and the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]], and flows south past the [[Forest-of-Thousand-Voices|Thousand Voices]] forest to the east before being joined by the Pitax River at the town of [[Voluse]]. It continues south from there near the town of [[Avendale]] and is joined by the Red Reed River soon thereafter. After this, it turns west and flows past the city of Gralton, after which it turns to the southwest and finally flows into the [[Sellen-River|Sellen River]] north of the [[Cordelon]] Forest.
