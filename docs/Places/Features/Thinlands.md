# Thinlands
This broad, flat area near the [[Tymon-Realm|Tymon]] border is both frightening and wonderful. All along this stretch of ground, observers see shadows of a forest that isnâ€™t there. In the winter, the shadow branches are bare, while in summer, they thicken, creating blocks of shade. Some parts of the land are covered in full shadow all year long presumably from an unseen mass of trees too thick to allow light. Crops grow well here, and the [[human]] residents hardly notice the strangeness, but for the occasional breakthrough from the [[First-World|First World]]. The walls between planes are thought to be especially thin here. Creatures from the [[First-World|First World]] sometimes appear unbidden, and disappear hours or days later.
