# West Sellen River
The West [[Sellen-River|Sellen River]] is part of the vast [[Sellen-River|Sellen River]] system but is, in itself, a long and important river forming the boundaries between nations for its entire 1,200-mile length.

South of Lake Laruba, the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]] form the eastern bank of the West [[Sellen-River|Sellen River]]. In this phase the river is joined by its tributary, the Twinetongue River. Eventually, the border of [[Ustalav]] turns westward and the river now becomes the border between [[Razmiran]] and the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]], as the river continues southwards.
