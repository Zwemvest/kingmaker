# Lake Silverstep
The cleanest and clearest source of water in the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]], Lake Silverstep draws from countless pristine streams and rivulets cascading down the steep tors to the east. Dozens of small waterfalls and foamy cascades make the lake’s eastern shores places of eldritch beauty, where ancient willows spread mossy canopies over islands of flowering reeds and lilies. Several small bands of fairies and faerie dragons dwell along the most secluded shores. Welcoming to those who don’t threaten their misty paradise, the [[fey]] tell of a wise old silver dragon who once laired amid the falls and from whom the lake takes its name. More than one eager wanderer, incited by fairy tales of gems and dragon silver, has discovered the caverns hidden behind several of the lake’s falls, just at its waterline, and below. Those who return speak of connections with caverns that run deep beneath the [[Tors-of-Levenies|Tors of Levenies]], of monstrous ossuaries, and of strange eyes that glow in the depths. Most, however, are never seen again.
