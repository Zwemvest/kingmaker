# Candlemere
Leaves from the [[Narlmarches|Narlmarches]] collect year round within the clear depths of the [[Candlemere|Candlemere]]. In spring and summer, the lake ref lects the colors trapped below in vibrant greens and rainbow bursts of flowering hues. By autumn, f iery reds, oranges, and yellows blaze through the water. In winter, the oft-frozen surface hides depthless blacks that make the lake appear as unfathomable as the night sky. Legends say that drinking from the [[Candlemere|Candlemere]] can, depending on the season, grant long life, cut a life short, intoxicate, or invigorate. In the middle of the lake lies a hilly island covered in mysterious willows, surrounding the ruins of an ancient, crumbling tower. Eerie witchlights glow above the tower on summer nights, and will-oâ€™-wisps congregate here throughout the fall, perhaps holding eerie councils or plotting whatever motivates their inscrutable deeds.
