# Crooked River
Descending from the [[Tors-of-Levenies|Tors of Levenies]], the Crooked River is a tributary of the [[Shrike-River|Shrike River]]. Its waters are fast and cold as they run between stony slopes and sharp rocks, but they slow and grow warmer as they reach the valley. Many mountain springs feed into the Crooked River, infusing it with minerals. The water's distinctive taste has led many locals to be wary of drinking it. Some alchemists, though, claim the unique chemical makeup of the water may actually provide it with healing properties.
