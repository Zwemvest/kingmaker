# Little Sellen River
A narrow but rapid tributary of the [[Shrike-River|Shrike River]], the Little [[Sellen-River|Sellen]]'s waters flow down from the [[Tors-of-Levenies|Tors of Levenies]], which frame the [[Kamelands]]. The Little [[Sellen-River|Sellen River]] is known for its extremely cold waters, fed directly from the glaciers of the tors, and it would likely freeze over if the waters were not so rapid.
