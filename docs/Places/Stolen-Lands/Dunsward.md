# Dunsward
This easternmost frontier of the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]] borders the steppes of Casmaron and the ancient ruins of [[Iobaria]]. Tribes of barbaric centaurs regularly traverse these low, grassy plains, seeing no distinction between this region and their pastoral homeland. Proud and suspicious of humanoids, these tribes avoid what they consider human lands, holding to an ages-old unspoken truce, and are both easily and violently provoked should their plains feel humanoid boots. Although the [[Brevoy|Brevic]] city of Restov lies nearby, the lands south of the river have traditionally been held as existing beyond [[Brevoy]]’s borders and are trod at great risk.
