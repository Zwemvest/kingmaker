# Glenebon Uplands
The [[Aldori-Swordlords|swordlords]] sent a relatively experienced band of adventurers into the westernmost reach of the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]]â€”an area that is supposedly under the rule of the [[Pitax-Realm|bandit kingdom of Pitax]] (although that [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdom]] has done very little to prove its claims over this area).

## [[Session-1#25 Calistril 4710|25 Calistril 4710]]
Jamadi Aldori formally extends a mission for the [[Iron-Wraiths]] in the [[The-expedition-for-the-Stolen-Lands|Expedition for the Stolen Lands]]. Tasked with operating in the [[Glenebon]] Uplands, their mission involves defeating the [[Tiger-Lords|Tiger Lords]], a formidable adversary, and establishing diplomatic relations with [[Pitax-Realm|Pitax]], a crucial diplomatic endeavor.
