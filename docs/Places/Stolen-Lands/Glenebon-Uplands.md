# Glenebon Uplands
The [[Aldori-Swordlords|swordlords]] sent a relatively experienced band of adventurers into the westernmost reach of the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]]â€”an area that is supposedly under the rule of the [[Pitax-Realm|bandit kingdom of Pitax]] (although that [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdom]] has done very little to prove its claims over this area).
