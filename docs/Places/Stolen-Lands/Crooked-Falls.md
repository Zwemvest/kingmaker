# Crooked Falls
Crooked Falls is a location within the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]] known for its picturesque landscape, situated near the [[Shrike-River|Shrike River]]. The [[Shrike-River|Shrike River]] cascades over a series of waterfalls here, each of which drops down 10 to 30 feet. There are five cascades in all over the course of a mile - the [[Crooked-River|Crooked River]] tributary flows into the [[Shrike-River|Shrike]] at approximately the midpoint of the series of waterfalls. These cascades make the [[Shrike-River|Shrike River]] a poor choice for trade between [[Brevoy]] and the south - all river trade normally flows along the East [[Sellen-River|Sellen]] through [[Hooktongue-Slough|Hooktongue Slough]] to the west.
