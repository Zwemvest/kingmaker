# Hemlock Island
Hemlock Island is an island located in the lake of [[Lake-Rushlight|Rushlight]] within the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]] of the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]], located north of the [[Lake-Rushlight|Rushlight]] Festival Grounds and south of the [[Glenebon]] Lowlands. While reputedly haunted by strange lights, the island is home to only rainbow egrets. A spring at the island's center is the source of the lake's water and empties in a river that flows into [[Pitax-Realm|Pitax]] to the southwest.
