# Tuskwater
Cliffs and steep hills hide this brown, rocky lake from almost every direction, though following any river through the [[Kamelands]] or [[Narlmarches]] inevitably leads to its waters. Sounders of boars frequently visit its shores and favor the thick briars and berry tangles between its western shore and the forest, these beasts granting the great arching body its name. Swelling with the spring thaw, the Tuskwater floods seasonally, spilling into swampy ravines all along its length but mainly to the west. This creates muddy gullies and pits of standing water where fierce swarms of mosquitoes, stirges, fat snakes, and assassin vines prey upon whatever falls into the quicksand- like muck. At more signif icant depths, the Tuskwater proves bountiful, with pike, longnose gar, bluegill, and— more dangerously—fanged eels. While fanged eels are well known for their slippery skins and vicious, painful bites, elder eels in the lake are known to grow up to 8 feet long and can ably reverse the stakes on any fisherman who tries to make a meal of them. Nevertheless, Tuskwater fanged eels are a delicacy on the tables of New Stetven in [[Brevoy]] to the north, making the reward well worth the danger.
