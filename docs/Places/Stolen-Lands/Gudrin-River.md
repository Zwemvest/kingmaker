# Gudrin River
The Gudrin River connects the [[Tuskwater]] with [[Lake-Silverstep|Lake Silverstep]]. The river makes numerous twists and turns along the [[Kamelands]], wending its way between the ancient kames. Boat trips along the river might make for excellent entertainment for tourists, but the dull landscapes of the [[Kamelands]] attract little attention from travelers. The river is mostly seen by treasure hunters in search of easy riches.
