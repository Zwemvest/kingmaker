# Outskirts
The Outskirts are the region of the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]] bordering with [[Brevoy]]. It has fewer monsters than the woods or marshes, but is plagued by numerous [[bandits]], many of them part of the [[Stag-Lord-Bandits\|Stag Lord's Bandits]]. For many years, [[Oleg-Leveton|Oleg Leveton]]'s trading post has served as the only bastion of civilization in this inhospitable realm.
