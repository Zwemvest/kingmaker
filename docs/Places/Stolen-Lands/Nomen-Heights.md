# Nomen Heights
The black hills of [[Glenebon]] march from the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]] into [[Numeria]]. Moody gray grasses and tangled scrub meander over rocky hills, regularly blasted by fierce winds in the spring and autumn and by summer brush fires. Few trees stand above the craggy hills and little shelter exists in the dusky land, with the hilltops mounted by barren stone and the valleys f illed with scrub and scree. While rain comes too often to transform the hill country into true badlands, the rugged plants that thrive in the area mean that little more than beetles, rodents, snakes, and mangy wolves prowl these hills. Several small prides of manticores find the region to their liking, however, and range from the Branthlend Mountains across the hills and into [[Numeria]], fighting each other for dominance and impaling any creature larger than a hare that falls under their shadow.

The swordlords sent a band of mercenaries into this region, rumors hold.
