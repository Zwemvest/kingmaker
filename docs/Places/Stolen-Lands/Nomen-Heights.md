# Nomen Heights
The Nomen Heights region of the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]], within the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]], is a wilderness of steppes and mountains dotted with camps of a centaur tribe and the small settlement of Varnhold. It encompasses much of the [[Dunsward]] frontier, the northern [[Tors-of-Levenies|Tors of Levenies]] mountain range and the several rivers flowing from its peaks, and other wildlands south of [[Restov]].

The Thicketfell, a region of foothills on the western side of the [[Tors-of-Levenies|Tors of Levenies]], is south of the Nomen Heights.

The easternmost reaches of the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]] contain a low mountain range and border the long-ruined realm of [[Iobaria]]. 

The [[Aldori-Swordlords|swordlords]] sent a band of mercenaries into this region, rumors hold.
