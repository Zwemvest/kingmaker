# Greenbelt
Dominated by the woodland known as the [[Narlmarches]] and the rolling hills of the [[Kamelands]], this region is the one your group has been chartered to explore. [[Bandits]] are particularly rife in this area, and the rumors that they’ve organized under the banner of a [[Bandits|bandit]] warlord who calls himself the [[Stag-Lord|Stag Lord]] are particularly troubling. 

Our party has been sent to explore as much of the northern half of the Greenbelt as we can and, if possible, to find out more about this “Stag Lord” and remove the [[Bandits|bandit]] threat from the region. Other rumored problems in the region include a tribe of mites, a tribe of kobolds, mischievous [[fey]], and numerous dangerous monsters and wildlife.
