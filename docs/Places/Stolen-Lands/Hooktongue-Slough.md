# Hooktongue Slough
Beyond the [[Narlmarches]] sink the lowlands of the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]], a great murky swamp of rotting trees and moldy mosses. Threaded through with hundreds of slow-moving rivulets and algae-clogged brooks, the Hooktongue Slough sprawls in a massive slime pit, home to all manner of stinging insects, sickly rodents, and croaking predators. Among the northern reaches, large snakes and strange water-striding creatures hunt in close proximity to [[Lake-Hooktongue|Lake Hooktongue]]. To the south, several tribes of boggards inhabit high mound-islands, defending their lands against all interlopers while avoiding the ill-reputed northern lake. Trolls also make occasional forays into the southern swamps, but in wariness of the frogfolk and their strange magics rarely attempt to expand their territory. With such obvious dangers and countless more unknown, few [[Human|humans]] would even consider entering the slough were it not for the azure lily, known to grow only amid the bogs just south of [[Lake-Hooktongue|Lake Hooktongue]]. Reputed to be able to cause paralysis in any creature that breathes its grainy blue pollen, the elusive lily has long been hunted for by [[bandits]] and assassins of all walks. While most believe the plant to be nothing more than a myth, occasionally a few pinches of a dangerous blue power appear in [[Pitax-Realm|Pitax]] or [[Daggermark-Realm|Daggermark]], spurring renewed interest in and searches for the plant. Such hunts, however, usually culminate in nothing more than more deaths and disappearances in the depths of the Hooktongue Slough.

Rumor holds that the [[Aldori-Swordlords|swordlords]] sent actual [[Brevoy|Brevic]] government agents into this swampy area.
