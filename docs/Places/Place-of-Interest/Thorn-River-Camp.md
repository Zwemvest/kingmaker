# Thorn River Camp
The [[../Stolen-Lands/Thorn-River.md|Thorn River]] Camp is a small camp or settlement situated at a low spot on the [[../Stolen-Lands/Thorn-River.md|Thorn River]]. The camp is a [[../../Creatures/Organizations/Bandits.md|bandit]] hub from which the lackeys of the local [[../../Creatures/Organizations/Bandits.md|bandit]] lord plan raids on the local populace. [[../../Creatures/Individuals/Happs-Bydon.md|Happs Bydon]] told us about the camp when we interrogated him after the [[../../Dictionary/Events/Bandit-attack-on-Olegs-Trading-Post.md|Bandit attack on Oleg's Trading Post]].
