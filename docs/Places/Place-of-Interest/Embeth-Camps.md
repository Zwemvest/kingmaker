## The Embeth Camps
Bearing a quiet and solemn composure, a band of nomads called the Embeth Travelers makes its home in the dense, marshy forest. Led by an avid woodsman named Jamel Visser (NG male [[human]] ranger 6), the group made clear its concerns about the dangers of the unstuck town and felt the [[fey]]-led raids put the settlement in significant danger. These citizens agreed to self-imposed exile shortly after the town’s first return to its proper time and place. They vowed to never return to Uringen proper. Not wanting to abandon the town completely, the Travelers also pledged protection for the settlement from those who would wish to harm it. 

The group dresses in simple green and gray outfits and display great skill with the longbow. The Embeth Travelers maintain a number of camps throughout the forest and make the best guides for those wishing to find the town, clusters of nightmoss, or other points of interest within the [[Embeth-Forest|Embeth Forest]], though they typically avoid the northern part of the forest and [[Sprys-Heart|Spry’s Heart]]. The Travelers are all passably skilled at tracking and have a reputation for being stealthy fighters. Other kingdoms occasionally attempt to hire the group as mercenaries, yet the Travelers refuse to leave their forest and abandon their wards. Constant clashes with an evil grig named Mather Nithra and his violent assortment of dark [[fey]] honed the Travelers’ skills at stealth and planning quick, decisive battles. With few outside aggressors, evil [[fey]] remain the primary enemies of Uringen, though the Travelers sometimes clash with neighboring mercenaries and the more unsavory residents of [[Nightmoss-Camp|Nightmoss Camp]]. 

The Travelers breed a particularly skilled variety of hunting dogs, called Embeth hounds, capable of tracking throughout the dense marshes and tangled forest. Hunters claim Embeth hounds can track a grig across a frozen marsh. These large dogs weigh around 100 pounds and have short, dense coats composed of mottled patches of white, black, and gray. Their eyes are usually light in color, and having two different-colored eyes is common. Fond of water, fiercely loyal, and skilled at tracking in difficult areas, these dogs provide a great boon to this group of rangers.
