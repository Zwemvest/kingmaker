# Nightmoss Camp
Having stolen the secret of nightmoss’s healing properties, Erinin Thulgath created her own camp on the southeastern edge of the [[Embeth-Forest|Embeth Forest]]. Known as Mother Nightmoss, she and the scraggly group that gathers under her banner brew potent alchemical products. The most famous of these are elixirs and salves distilled from nightmoss, and it is said hers can do things that the best alchemists in town cannot accomplish, such as bringing back the dead (see sidebar). Little more than a haphazard collection of tents and lean- tos covering cauldrons and workbenches, Nightmoss Camp looks like a portable, woodland factory. The population of Nightmoss Camp contains equal parts ruffian and alchemist. Eager to capitalize on the region’s reputation for alchemical goods and curatives, many a dishonest salesman claims heritage from Uringen. The quality of these products (and those who sell them) is always in question; however, there are a number of genuine articles among a sea of charlatans. Many of these tricksters reside in Nightmoss Camp alongside true practitioners of the art of alchemy.
