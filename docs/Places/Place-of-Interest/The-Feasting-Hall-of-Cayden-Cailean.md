# The Feasting Hall of Cayden Cailean
In southeastern [[Mivon-Realm|Mivon]], there is a bald hill—no trees or grass grow on its surface, and a ring of standing stones decorates its crown. Every few years, though not on any fixed schedule, the standing stones spontaneously expand and change to become the walls and roof of a grand and mysterious feasting hall, rumored to be that of [[Cayden-Cailean|Cayden Cailean]] himself. Anyone who comes to the hill on that evening can disappear inside for a night or a decade of feasting and festivity. 

Music, laughter, and sounds of revelry spill from every lighted window, and the morning after, when the stones resume their normal appearance, the hilltop stinks of spilled ale and wine. The last time, though, villagers who approached the hilltop afterward found blood—a lot of blood—among the stones.
