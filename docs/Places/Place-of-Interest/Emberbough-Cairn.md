# Emberbough Cairn
Emberbough Cairn is rumored to be connected to a civilization that supposedly predates [[Taldor]], or even the [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords|Kellid]] tribes that [[Taldor]]'s Armies of Exploration displaced, in what is now the [[Emberbough-Forest|Emberbough Forest]] of the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]]. The cairn lies east of the ruins of [[Heibarr]].

By 4710 AR, despite numerous expeditions to the cairn, no treasure had been found there.
