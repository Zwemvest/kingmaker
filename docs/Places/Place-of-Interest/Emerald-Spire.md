# Emerald Spire
The Emerald Spire is a strange ruin in the northwestern [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]]. Located in a large clearing in the [[Echo-Wood|Echo Wood]] near the [[River-Road|Crusader Road]], six miles northeast of the [[Hellknights|Hellknight]]-ruled settlement of Fort Inevitable, the spire is well known to locals and travellers in the region.

Believed to be an Azlanti ruin from the era before Earthfall, most think the Emerald Spire refers to the ruins of large tower of green glass that rises above the clearing. However, the spire itself is far more ancient, a needle of magical crystal that reaches two miles into the earth, into the very vaults of Orv.
