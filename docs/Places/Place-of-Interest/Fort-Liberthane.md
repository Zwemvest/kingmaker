# Fort Liberthane
This small fortress is home to approximately 50 soldiers. These numbers wax and wane as [[Achille-Parsall|Achille Parsall]] sends followers on various missions. Several farming and ranching families have settled in simple houses nearby, but are always ready to fall back to the protection of the fort.
