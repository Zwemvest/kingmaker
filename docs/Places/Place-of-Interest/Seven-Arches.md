# Seven Arches
Somewhere within the [[Wilewood]], found on no maps (and by few [[Human|humans]]), is a great clearing hundreds of feet across. Arranged according to some arcane design, seven arches stand in the clearing, carved from gray-brown basalt quarried nowhere in the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]]. Time and nature have challenged but not defeated the true arches. Vines climb the sides, and moss half covers the stone carvings of animals and magical beasts. Each arch is a different size and shape; the highest towers 50 feet overhead and 30 feet wide, brushing the lower forest canopy, hinting at the size of what could be summoned through it. Those who sense magic find the arches’ presence nearly overwhelming, bright as bonfires on a moonless night. Others find the clearing unsettling, possessed of a high ringing in the ears, or a vague acrid smell. 

Ten thousand years ago, these arches were powerful gates to strange places, including the [[First-World|First World]], and the [[Elf|elves]] used them freely. Now they have somehow become mistuned, perhaps leading to otherworld realms, but certainly degenerated into portals of [[fey]] disease that disgorge evil monstrosities known as the [[Gorga|gorgas]]. [[Gorga|Gorgas]] come in a bewildering variety of animalistic shapes, but all have teeth, claws, and eyes of pure shadow. The sacred charge of the [[Oakstewards]] is to protect [[Golarion]] from the [[Gorga|gorgas]] that emerge from these portals. What else can be summoned through is a mystery to all but the [[Oakstewards]].

The [[Oakstewards]] have also learned that [[Elf|elves]] who come near the portals are stricken with an unnatural plague, one which not even the druids can treat or cure. Known as the Obnubilate Plague, the malady destroys not only an [[elf]] ’s body, but also his memory. [[Oakstewards|Oaksteward]] lore says the plague is highly contagious, so the druids do not allow infected [[Elf|elves]] to leave the clearing again, lest they pass it on to others of their kind. The druids suspect that a cure might lie on the other side of one of the portals, but none of their exploratory parties have ever returned, and they don't even know if their search parties chose the right portal. 

Every few [[human]] generations, a band of [[Elf|elves]] breaks through the [[Oakstewards]]’ protections intent on reclaiming their former holding. The arches become more active when [[Elf|elves]] are nearby—the [[Gorga|gorgas]] on the other side of the portals can sense their approach. This is detrimental to both the [[Elf|elves]] (as the plague strikes quickly) and the [[Sevenarches-Realm|kingdom of Sevenarches]] (since the [[Gorga|gorgas]] ravage the [[Sevenarches-Realm|kingdom]] until the [[Oakstewards]] can slay or banish them). 

For these reasons, the [[Oakstewards]] ban [[Elf|elves]] from entering [[Sevenarches-Realm|Sevenarches]]. They dare not even explain their motive, because they believe [[Kyonin]]’s Queen Edasseril and her court will be too proud to listen to mere [[human]] counsel. Believing in their own ability to handle the dangers, the [[Oakstewards]] think the [[Elf|elves]] would bring in an army and unwittingly spread the Obnubilate Plague to every [[elf]] on [[Golarion]]. While the [[Oakstewards]] do not think highly of [[Elf|elves]], neither do they want them dead.
