# River Road
The River Road is the name given to the water route on the [[Sellen-River|Sellen River]] between the [[Inner-Sea|Inner Sea]] and the [[Lake-of-Mists-and-Veils|Lake of Mists and Veils]] in northern [[Avistan]]. It is generally associated with the [[Mendev|Mendevian]] Crusades, as it is the route that crusaders and pilgrims take on their way to the nation of [[Mendev]] and from there to battle the demons of the Worldwound.

## Crusader Road
The Crusader Road is an offshoot of the River Road, and is an alternate way for crusaders and pilgrims to travel to [[Mendev]]. It follows the [[Sellen-River|Sellen River]] from Cassomir to [[Kallas-Lake|Kallas Lake]], but splits there from the River Road, travelling up the [[West-Sellen-River|West Sellen River]] north of [[Kyonin]] and continuing on that waterway past the nation of [[Razmiran]] and the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]] settlements of Tymon, [[Maashinelle]], [[Thornkeep]], and [[Lockridge]]. The Crusader Road in the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]] is heavily patrolled by [[bandits]], confidence men, and others who wish to separate the naive or unprepared from their wealth.

West of the [[Echo-Wood|Echo Wood]] it serves as the border between [[Numeria]] and [[Ustalav]], passing the towns of Vische, Dravod Knock, and Aaramor and ends at Nerosyan.

The Crusader Road was the primary route for reaching [[Mendev]] during the First and Second [[Mendev|Mendevian]] Crusades. After the Sarkorian town of Storasta (that sits on the [[West-Sellen-River|West Sellen]]) fell during the Second Crusade, the route became too dangerous, and the crusaders instead chose the longer path up the [[Sellen-River|Sellen]] proper through the [[Numeria|Numerian]] city of Chesed.
