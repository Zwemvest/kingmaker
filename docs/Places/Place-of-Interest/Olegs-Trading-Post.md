# Oleg's Trading Post
[[Oleg-Leveton|Oleg]]'s Trading Post is a small settlement south of [[Brevoy]] and North of the Greenbelt. For many travellers, it has been the last stop and one of the few hospitable shelters between civilization and the [[Stolen-Lands|endless wilds]] that laid beyond it. It is run by [[Oleg-Leveton|Oleg]] and [[Svetlana-Leveton|Svetlana Leveton]], a couple from [[Restov]], who have rebuilt an old fort into a trading post. 

The trading post is an old abandoned border fort at the southern edge of [[Rostland]] that was taken over by trolls. When the trolls disappeared, [[Oleg-Leveton|Oleg]] moved in and took over the building with the help of a contingent of soldiers who assisted in rebuilding. The soldiers, however, were called back to [[Brevoy]] in the month of Lamashan. A relief contingent was supposed to arrive by the month of Kuthona, but an early winter kept them sheltered in [[Restov]].

The Trading Post was the first destination on the party's [[The-expedition-for-the-Stolen-Lands|Expedition for the Stolen Lands]]. [[Jamandi-Aldori|Lady Jamandi Aldori]] told the party that the trading post had been recently harassed by [[bandits]], and that the party should function as an early relief effort. 

[[Oleg-Leveton|Oleg]] and [[Svetlana-Leveton|Svetlana]] explained that [[bandits]] harassed the post at the earliest hour of dawn, at the beginning of every month. The [[bandits]] argued that they were mere "collecting tax"

The party set up traps to fend off the [[bandits]] during the [[Bandit-attack-on-Olegs-Trading-Post|Bandit attack on Oleg's Trading Post]]. The plan was successful, and three of the attackers died. A fourth attacker, [[Happs-Bydon|Happs Bydon]], was captured by the party and interrogated.
