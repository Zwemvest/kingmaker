# Hawk's Nest
The fortress home of the Yenchabur assassins, the Hawk’s Nest is an impressive structure built with only one passable entrance carved into the long cliff face below the fortress’s walls. The path includes two wooden bridges that can be collapsed or burned in the event of a siege. A tunnel below the fortress descends more than 1,500 feet into the earth and connects the Hawk’s Nest to a natural aquifer as its protected source of water. Full members of the Yenchabur assassins reside here, awaiting assignment either as a Vessel Between or as a teacher at the [[Daggermark-Assassins-Guild|Daggermark Assassins’ Guild]]. All Yenchabur assassins must teach at some point during their service, and must serve at the Hawk’s Nest as well. Outsiders are not permitted within the fortress walls—instead they must wait at the base of the cliff until they’re noticed or acknowledged; sometimes for days. After [[Galt]] fell, remnants of that nation’s armies targeted Daggermark as a new home and tried to lay siege to the Hawk’s Nest to ensure the assassins wouldn’t be able to aid in Daggermark’s defense. The siege lasted 8 days and ended in a single night with the deaths of more than a dozen [[Galt|Galtan]] officers. It’s still not entirely clear if the Yenchabur killed those officers, but the rank-and-file soldiers didn’t stick around to ask. There have long been rumors that below the Hawk’s Nest lies a secret city, home to the families of the assassins in the fortress above. The residents of the Hawk’s Nest shrug off such suggestions and claim their lives there are spent in quiet solitude and study.
