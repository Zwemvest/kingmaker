# South Rostland Road
Well-traveled dirt and gravel road leading from [[Olegs-Trading-Post|Oleg's Trading Post]], past the [[Crooked-Falls|Crooked Falls]], to [[Nivaktas-Crossing|Nivakta's Crossing]], and ending in [[Restov]] in the east, where travellers can then continue north and west up into [[Brevoy]]. It functionally serves as the southern border to [[Brevoy]], though some in [[Brevoy]] may argue that [[Brevoy]] continues beyond this road.
