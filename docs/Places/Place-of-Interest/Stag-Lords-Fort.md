# Stag Lord's Fort
The Stag Lord's Fort is a heavily fortified fort situated at a low spot on the [[../Stolen-Lands/Thorn-River.md|Thorn River]]. The camp is a hub for the [[Stag-Lord-Bandits|Stag Lord's Bandits]] from which the lackeys of the [[Stag-Lord|Stag Lord]] plan raids on the local populace. [[../../Creatures/Individuals/Happs-Bydon.md|Happs Bydon]] told us about the camp when we interrogated him after the [[Stag-Lord-Bandit-attack-on-Olegs-Trading-Post|Bandit attack on Oleg's Trading Post]].
