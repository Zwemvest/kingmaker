# River Kingdoms
Scattered among the forests and marshes of the Sellen River basin are the River Kingdoms: a loose confederation of tiny, independent states, the largest of them holding only a few thousand souls. Hundreds of such kingdoms have risen and fallen over the centuries, for treachery and chaos are rife in this region, and few River Kingdoms outlive their founders. 

The lawless reputation of the River Kingdoms draws outcasts, refugees, and anyone else so desperate to escape their pasts that carving out a new life in a rough frontier town seems like an attractive proposition. Such settlers rarely have much money, and as the skills developed in their homelands are often ill suited to hardscrabble lives in the river basin, they generally find it difficult to rebuild their fortunes. The region is further depressed by the River Kingdoms’ instability, which deters trade, investment, and even travel. Thus, most of the River Kingdoms are poor, isolated, and backward—but stubbornly, proudly free.
## History
The massive Sellen River basin drains all the eastern lands, carrying waters from the Lake of Mists and Veils north of Brevoy, the massive Lake Encarthan, and lakes and rivers all over Galt, Numeria, and Ustalav down to the Inner Sea. As the tributaries pass through the hundred marshes and forests of the River Kingdoms, they seem to carry an especially heavy freight of sin, treachery, and thievery, for the River Kingdoms are where desperate men go to escape their pasts and carve out new lives.

A true history of the River Kingdoms could fill a number of tomes, for the kingdoms that currently thrive or struggle here are but the most recent. Dozens, if not hundreds, of kingdoms have risen and fallen in this region over the past several thousand years—some, like Razmiran, have managed to stabilize and become their own nations, while others have faded forever into obscurity. Yet regardless of each specific kingdom’s creed or goal, they all share one rough code of justice called the Six River Freedoms. Not all honor the code, but enough do that it serves as a sort of shorthand for the independence that all people of the River Kingdoms hold dear, the closest thing this region has to a common ground and shared legacy. 

## The River Freedoms 
The six freedoms are summarized below.
### Say What You Will, I Live Free:   
Talk is cheap, and everyone is entitled to speak their own words.
### Oathbreakers Die:  
Those who swear oaths—particularly those of fealty to a River King—and break them can expect any number of painful and lethal fates
### Walk Any Road, Float Any River:   
Freedom to travel is fundamental. No River Kingdom is allowed to bar traffic on a river or a road, save in times of active warfare.
### Courts Are for Kings:   
The law is always malleable. Who you know and who you can count as friends are more important than what the law says, and a lord can change laws in his territory at will.
### Slavery Is an Abomination:   
Slavers may visit the River Kingdoms, but taking or holding slaves there upsets the many people who were once slaves themselves.
### You Have What You Hold:   
Property laws are weak in the River Kingdoms. Taking something openly by force is different from stealing, and those who can’t protect their property don’t deserve to keep it.

### Government
Each of the tiny River Kingdoms follows its own ruler or council, and each possesses its own idiosyncrasies. Most are city-states of a few thousand souls at most. The River Kingdoms are bound together by the River Freedoms and by the Outlaw Council, a group that gathers each year in Daggermark, a town known for its effective assassins’ and poisoners’ guilds (and thus rarely a target of conquest). At the Outlaw Council, rulers of the region’s various holdings gather to argue, fight, and plan how to keep their freedom for another year against the larger forces arrayed against them. The Riverfolk would be offended at the very idea that their lands have a prime city or ruling principality, although if pressed they might confess that Daggermark comes closest. Others might argue that Gralton is the most central city, or Sevenarches the oldest, but Daggermark is the largest and has long served as the seat of the Outlaw Council.
