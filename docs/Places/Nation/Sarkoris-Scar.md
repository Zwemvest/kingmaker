# Sarkoris Scar
The Sarkoris Scar is a jagged, black gash that runs across the land once known as Sarkoris and, more recently, as the Worldwound. Although the yawning portal to the Abyss is no more, the land of the Sarkoris Scar continues to be infested with demons, and the [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords|Kellid]] descendants of the original inhabitants of Sarkoris still have a long way to go before they can reclaim their ancestors' land.

Much of the land of the Sarkoris Scar now is little more than blackened, broken, and uneven rock, a direct result of its nearly century-long exposure to the Abyssal portal of the Worldwound. It stretches from the frigid plains of the [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords|Realm of the Mammoth Lords]] in the west to the [[West-Sellen-River|West Sellen River]] and its border with the nation of [[Mendev]] in the east, and from the immense boreal Stonewilds in the north, to the Shudderwood, the Moutray River, and the border with [[Ustalav]] and [[Numeria]] in the south. Other major geographical features include the the forests known as the Petrified Library, the Winged Wood, the Forest of Embers, and the Needleglens, along with the Lake Lost to the Sun, the Wolfcrags, and the Frostmire Fen.
