# Iobaria
The land of Iobaria is located east of the nation of [[Brevoy]], north of the Castrovin Sea, and is considered part of the continent of Casmaron. [[Human]] settlers have united the land into an empire in the past, but currently the land is largely wilderness thanks to a series of plagues that have severely depopulated the region.

## History
In ancient days, [[Lands-of-the-Linnorm-Kings|Ulfen]] explorers from [[Avistan]] journeyed north along the edge of the world, finally turning south long after leaving the northern shores of the [[Lake-of-Mists-and-Veils|Lake of Mists and Veils]] behind, until they reached the Castrovin Sea, where they spread out to try to tame a hostile land. In time, their settlements emerged as Iobaria, a powerful kingdom that spread its influence throughout Casmaron via the Castrovin’s numerous waterways. In the second millennia of the Age of Enthronement, Iobaria blossomed into an empire whose colonies stretched into [[Avistan]] in the form of [[Issia]] (now [[Brevoy]]) and [[Mendev]]. A series of tenacious plagues toppled Iobaria from greatness, the most potent being the Choking Death of 2742 ar, nearly 2 millennia ago. Three-quarters of its people fell to the calamity, leaving the empire’s great wooden palaces and forest cities almost completely abandoned. Vassal states rebelled without fear of Iobaria’s devastated armies, only to collapse themselves without the meager institutional support of the heartland. The Choking Death never truly vanished from the pine forests of Iobaria. It and a host of other mysterious illnesses have, along with internecine strife, kept the local population near its nadir for centuries
