# Varisia
While the other territories within the Saga Lands might possess lengthier histories as established nations, the events of recent years have propelled the untamed regions of Varisia (pronounced vah-RHIS-ee-ah) into contemporary prominence. A significant portion of Varisia's ancient history, particularly its role as the heart of the Thassilonian empire, has only recently been unveiled by contemporary historians and scholars.

Varisia is a vast, sparsely populated region in the northwest of [[Avistan]]. It stretches from the Steaming Sea in the west to the Mindspin Mountains in the east and from the Kodar Mountains in the north to Conqueror's Bay in the south. Geographically, Varisia is split into two regions. The southern and southwestern region are generally lowlands with a few forested mountains along with rich grasslands, forests, and swamps. The northeastern section is dominated by the harsh and drier Storval Plateau and Cinderlands.

Varisia is bordered to the north by the recently founded nation of New Thassilon, to the south by shadowy Nidal, to the southeast by Nirmathas and the hobgoblin nation of Oprak, and to the east by the [[Orc|orcs]] of Belkzen.

Even though Varisia is sparsely settled, [[Human|humans]] are still the majority population here, although significant pockets of other peoples exist here as well. The [[Human|humans]] are primarily of Shoanti, Varisian, and [[Taldor|Taldan]] heritage, with a fair number of [[Lands-of-the-Linnorm-Kings|Ulfen]], and even [[Tian-Xia|Tien]] thrown into the mix as well.
