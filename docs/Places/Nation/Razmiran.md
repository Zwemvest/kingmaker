# Razmiran
The realm known as Razmiran (pronounced RAZZ-meer-ann) was once a turbulent, violent River Kingdom called the Arch-Duchy of Melcat, where leadership changed as often as the years. This ended in 4661 AR, when the land was conquered by Razmir, a petty tyrant masquerading as a god. 

## History
The northeastern shores of [[Lake-Encarthan|Lake Encarthan]] have always been a turbulent place. For centuries, this land was part of the unruly [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]], changing hands dozens of times from one burgeoning
prince to the next. All of that changed 47 years ago, when the living god Razmir came to the shores and claimed his dominion in the world of mortals.

Razmir first appeared to the people of Xer (then part of the Arch-Duchy of Melcat) and told them of his power. He claimed to have taken the Test of the Starstone in faraway Absalom, and to have attained divinity through this test. Using his supposedly divine powers, Razmir set about gathering a flock by ousting the local magistrate and the Trades Guild, “exposing” them as a front for thieves and extortionists. Those who came to worship him, however, knew nothing of the truth: Razmir expelled the magistrate by murdering him and disbanded the Trades Guild by incorporating all of its members into his faith. Razmir’s biggest lie, however, is hidden from even his most trusted followers—for Razmir is not in fact a god. Although powerful, he is simply a man, and one whose mortal end grows closer with every day.

In the months following his takeover of Xer, Razmir’s faith spread across the arch-duchy until it reached the capital of Aerduin on the border of the Vergan Forest. The forces of Melcat refused to bow to Razmir’s faith, and on 17 Erastus, Razmir himself came to the city. He made three requests for fealty to Duke Melcat—each one was refused. That night, a terrible cloud of fire and smoke descended upon the city and screams echoed through the night. By morning, the entire city had been reduced to ash and Razmir’s takeover was complete. In the years since, Razmiran—as the theocracy came to be called—has expanded its borders five times at the expense of various [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]].

Today, Razmiran is a society governed by force and intimidation. The faith’s ruthless priests control every facet of the state and economy from behind their iron masks (worn in imitation of their god). While the common folk toil at their fields or meager trades, the true faithful take a portion of the commoners’ work known as the Tithing Step. The higher-level clergy, meanwhile, enjoy a life of comfort, with their station in the faith granting them a great deal of power and wealth. Those who dare to defy the faith face severe punishment—imprisonment, exile, or even execution. This leads many to join the faith as a path of prosperity, regardless of their belief. Such acolytes are sent to the Exalted Wood for training and come back changed, acting in league with the faith despite any previous misgivings
