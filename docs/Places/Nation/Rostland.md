# Rostland
The fertile region of Rostland is one of the two nations conglomerated into the modern day state of [[Brevoy]] in northeastern [[Avistan]]. Known for its master swordsmen and proud, defiant citizenry, Rostland stands on the verge of civil war with its northern neighbor [[Issia]], which has gained political control of the region since the disappearance of [[Brevoy]]'s ruling House Rogarvia in 4699 AR.

Rostland occupies the southern half of the nation of [[Brevoy]], from Gronzi Forest and Lake Reykal on its northern borders to the frontier capital of [[Restov]] and the edge of the untamed wilderness of the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]] in the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]] to the south. The heavily traveled [[Sellen-River|Sellen River]] flows through Rostland, carrying the produce from its fertile farmlands and grassy rolling hills throughout the region. For centuries, the rich stores of food from Rostland have sustained the more desolate region of [[Issia]] to the north.

Most Rostlandi are simple farmers, craftsmen, and tradesmen, possessing outgoing and happy personalities. The people of Rostland are welcoming of strangers, but do require that visitors to their land conform to the plentiful and intricate local customs. Obsessed with honor and personal standing, Rostlandi are easy to provoke or offend, and one wrong word can quickly find the offender in front of the local magistrate or in a personal duel. Despite their proud, parochial tendencies, Rostlandi make loyal allies and fast friends if outsiders prove their worth by learning and adhering to the native customs.
## History
In 4499 AR, the armies of [[Choral-Rogarvia|Choral the Conqueror]] swept into Rostland, and despite a strong resistance mustered by the [[Aldori-Swordlords|swordlords]], the nation fell at the barbarian's hand and at the talons of his red dragon servitors. The most memorable conflict between the Rostlandi and [[Choral-Rogarvia|Choral]]'s armies is now known as the Valley of Fire, and somber songs of swordlord Estruan Aldori's defeat remain a popular aspect of folk culture in [[Brevoy]], the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]], and [[Mendev]]. After annihilating the Rostlandi army, [[Choral-Rogarvia|Choral]]'s red dragons turned their attention to Rostland itself, and initiated a brutal onslaught of fire and blood that brought the once-proud nation to its knees. In only a handful of days, the people of Rostland surrendered to their new ruler and his heirs in House Rogarvia.

Many Aldori [[Aldori-Swordlords|swordlords]] fled Rostland under [[Choral-Rogarvia|Choral]]'s rule, establishing a strong presence in the [[Mivon-City|city of Mivon]] to the south, amid the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]]. Others fled to the Free City of [[Restov]] in the far south of [[Brevoy]]. The Aldori stronghold of Skywatch maintained the resistance even after the rest of Rostland had fallen, but even this seat of independent Aldori power was reduced to ashes by [[Choral-Rogarvia|Choral]] and his dragons, eventually to be rebuilt by House Rogarvia.
