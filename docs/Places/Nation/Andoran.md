# Andoran
Andoran (pronounced ann-DOHR-ann) is a nation of the people, governed by the principles of Common Rule that grant every citizen a voice in elections that chose their representatives to the government. Andoran holds the reins of its own destiny in the strong hands of its people; it considers itself the birthplace of freedom.

The [[Eagle-Knights|Eagle Knights]] personify Andoren idealism, serving as unwavering and devoted warriors who pledge to safeguard not just their nation but also its principles of freedom (particuarly manumission), equality, and justice. Distinguished by their distinctive blue-and-gold uniforms and eagle emblems, they are easily recognized and seen across the [[Inner-Sea|Inner Sea]] region.
