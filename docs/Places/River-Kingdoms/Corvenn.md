# Corvenn
Corvenn was a nation that broke away from [[Pitax-Realm|Pitax]] in the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]] for nearly 50 years during the 47th century AR.

In 4612 AR, a civil war erupted between the Cattanei family and Liacenza family in [[Pitax-Realm|Pitax]], splitting it into the rival kingdoms of Corvenn in the northwest and [[Pitax-Realm|Pitax]] in the east. Corvenn allied with [[Numeria]] during the rebellion.

The war culminated in an incident known as the "Deafening Flames", in which rebels from Corvenn burned [[Pitax-City|Pitax]]'s western wall and destroyed half of the city. In 4661 AR, the marriage of Sebilla Cattanei and Raimon Liacenza reunited the two warring families, as well as the countries under the rule of a [[Pitax-Realm|single government]].
