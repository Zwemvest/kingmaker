# Artume
Plagued by assassinations and treachery, Artume is a kingdom without a king. Only unexpected luck or the aid of a powerful new patron can save this realm from becoming the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]]’ most recent failure.  
## History
Amid rolling hills and fertile plains, the kingdom of Artume lies along the western fork of the [[Sellen-River|Sellen River]] within a day’s ride of [[Daggermark-City|Daggermark]], [[Gralton-City|Gralton]], and Sevenarches. The settlement first formed around a large keep built by Lord Drellis Artume in 4672 when the nobleman’s family and retainers fled the People’s Revolt in [[Andoran]]. After successfully organizing local ranchers to coordinate their defense against bandit raids, he eventually proclaimed himself king—a social reach he further cemented by granting lands and titles to those swearing fealty to him.

Unfortunately, after repeated disagreements with the [[Outlaw-Council|Outlaw Council]], Drellis fell victim to [[Daggermark-Realm|Daggermark]] [[Daggermark-Poisoners-Guild|poisoners]] in 4690. His wife, Queen Sovella, left the kingdom in the hands of Sir Bransen Waike, a visiting templar and veteran of the [[Mendev|Mendevian]] Crusades, to serve as regent until she could give birth to Artume’s son. Unknown to Sovella, however, the duplicitous Waike forsook his Crusader’s Oath and led his men to abandon the front lines of the Worldwound and find fortune elsewhere. After publicly gaining authority over Artume, Waike secretly tried to assassinate the queen and blame it on [[Daggermark-Realm|Daggermark]]. Sovella escaped and now raises her son, Edryd, in hiding until she can prepare him to reclaim his father’s crown. Waike claims the queen perished at the hands of her attackers, while retaining the throne for himself.
