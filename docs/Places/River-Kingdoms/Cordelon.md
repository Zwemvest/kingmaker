# Cordelon
Once used by the [[Elf|elves]] as a staging ground for their return to Golarion after their self-imposed exile preceding Earthfall, this small kingdom has been claimed by a loose-knit tribe of [[Human|humans]].  

## History
What is now the kingdom of Cordelon was once a staging facility for [[Elf|elves]] returning to Kyonin. Abandoned by the [[Elf|elves]] for unknown reasons three centuries later, the region now plays home to a small number of [[Half-elf|half-elves]] and their [[human]] families, living simple lives in tune with nature and emulating their [[Elf|elven]] ancestors’ habits. Now a loose-knit tribe of isolated [[Human|humans]] claims the area for its own. The result of half-[[Elf|elven]] and [[human]] interbreeding for generations, these people show faint traces of [[Elf|elven]] blood—a slight point to their ears, larger than normal pupils, and a thin but sinewy muscle tone—but most are otherwise fully [[human]]. While awkward and quiet around outsiders, even in the village streets of Novoboro, native Cordelans are wily and resourceful in their natural habitat.

Thorny acacias and honey locusts grow abundantly along the tree-lined borders of Cordelon, and stinging nettles and poison sumac choke out other plants in the underbrush. Druids tell tales of the wall of thorny plants a hundred feet thick that surrounds this territory. To keep the area safe, the natives nurture and tend the plants, encouraging the growth of their lands’ natural defenses—though callous explorers and those willing to exploit the land often chop or burn their way through the barrier to reach the natural treasures within
