# Stolen Lands
This large swath of land along the northeastern border serves as a buffer between [[Brevoy]] and the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]]—traditionally the haunt of [[bandits]] and monstrous humanoids, the Stolen Lands are regarded as “stolen” by all nations along its border, even though none have ever been able to keep these realms under their control for long.  

## History
Across the northern frontier of the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]] runs a hinterland not even the most brazen [[Bandits|bandit]] lords dare to claim. Sharing borders with strange barbarians and the scions of a proud kingdom, this wilderness invites few intruders, out of fear of provoking the ire of empires. For untold decades this land has lain fallow, left to the devices of nature and deadly beasts, while strange things lurk amid its swamps, forests, and peaks, and the remnants of an ancient, near-forgotten history sleeps amid ruins and weeds. These are the Stolen Lands, a lordless realm having defied untold conquerors, yet ripe with potential for any bold enough to prove themselves its masters.

The regions called the Stolen Lands takes its name from [[Brevoy]], which claims this realm as rightfully its own. The fertile plains of the [[Brevoy|Brevic]] demesne of [[Rostland]] spill into the region, coloring the fractious nation’s claim on the wilderness. This makes the border between the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]] and the northern realm hotly contested, with the descendants of [[Choral-Rogarvia|Choral the Conquerer]] —the unifier of modern [[Brevoy]]—and ancient [[Rostland|Rostlandic]] nobles claiming right to lands as far south as [[Hooktongue-Slough|Hooktongue Slough]] and the [[Kamelands]], and some brash families asserting their reach extends as far south as the [[Bandits|bandit]] city of [[Pitax-City|Pitax]]. Beyond the plains, to the east stretch the craggy forests of the [[Narlmarches]] and rugged hill country that gradually rises in the wall- like mountains called the [[Tors-of-Levenies|Tors of Levenies]]. To the west, the many rivers and bogs of the [[Hooktongue-Slough|Hooktongue Slough]] transform the region’s lowlands into a vast swamp, eventually giving way to the [[Spinefields]], weedy plains threaded over with bony crags, with the forest of [[Forest-of-Thousand-Voices|Thousand Voices]] and the steeps around [[Mount-Branthlend|Mount Branthlend]] beyond. Diverse in both vistas and dangers, the Stolen Lands hide a variety of dangers, from tales of hauntings and eerie lights in the west to claims of ruins from forgotten empires scattered across the east, with the dens of [[Bandits|bandit]] gangs, strange recluses, and deadly beasts scattered throughout. Those who travel the land, whether as traders or conquerors, find it a rugged, unforgiving region, one that has defied ages of settlers as if it consciously preferred to remain a realm of brutality and beasts. Yet endlessly, new generations enter the land with ambitions and steel, ever hoping to carve out a piece of the Stolen Lands for themselves.
