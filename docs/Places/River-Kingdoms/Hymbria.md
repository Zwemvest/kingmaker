# Hymbria
This woodland kingdom was established by [[Kyonin]] as a base of operations for [[Elf|elven]] interests in the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]].  Only [[Elf|elves]] dedicated to the reclamation of [[Sevenarches-Realm|Sevenarches]] are allowed beneath the trees of this secretive outpost.
## History
Just to the south of the [[Embeth-Forest|Embeth Forest]] lies a dense woodland. A branch of the [[Sellen-River|Sellen River]] cuts through the westernmost part of the forest, providing a path for those who seek Hymbrian goods. The forest kingdom was established by [[Elf|elves]] from [[Kyonin]] as a base from which they will, eventually, reclaim the ancient [[Elf|elven]] site of [[Sevenarches-Realm|Sevenarches]]. [[Kyonin]]’s [[Elf|elves]] don’t wish to exterminate the [[Human|humans]] who hold this territory—at least, not until they’ve exhausted all other options. The Hymbrian [[Elf|elves]], however, have become less patient, and look to their contacts in [[Daggermark-Realm|Daggermark]] as an important step toward the reclamation of [[Sevenarches-Realm|Sevenarches]].

Hymbrian [[Elf|elves]] get along well enough with their neighbors, as long as those neighbors keep a proper distance. Trading outposts are situated on either side of the river, but only [[Elf|elves]] are permitted beneath the trees of Hymbria, and most members of other races who trespass are slain on sight. The [[Elf|elves]]’ traffic with [[Daggermark-Realm|Daggermark]] is earning them an increasingly dark reputation, but so far none of Hymbria’s neighbors suspect the [[Elf|elves]]’ true purpose.
