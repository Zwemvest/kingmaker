# Hymbria
This woodland kingdom was established by Kyonin as a base of operations for elven interests in the River Kingdoms.  Only elves dedicated to the reclamation of Sevenarches are allowed beneath the trees of this secretive outpost.

# History
Just to the south of the Embeth Forest lies a dense woodland. A branch of the Sellen River cuts through the westernmost part of the forest, providing a path for those who seek Hymbrian goods. The forest kingdom was established by elves from Kyonin as a base from which they will, eventually, reclaim the ancient elven site of Sevenarches. Kyonin’s elves don’t wish to exterminate the humans who hold this territory—at least, not until they’ve exhausted all other options. The Hymbrian elves, however, have become less patient, and look to their contacts in Daggermark as an important step toward the reclamation of Sevenarches.

Hymbrian elves get along well enough with their neighbors, as long as those neighbors keep a proper distance. Trading outposts are situated on either side of the river, but only elves are permitted beneath the trees of Hymbria, and most members of other races who trespass are slain on sight. The elves’ traffic with Daggermark is earning them an increasingly dark reputation, but so far none of Hymbria’s neighbors suspect the elves’ true purpose.
