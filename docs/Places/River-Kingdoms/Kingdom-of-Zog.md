# Kingdom of Zog
The Kingdom of Zog was a small empire of [[Goblin|goblins]] ruled by a dynasty of seven barghests in the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]].

First created in 4071 AR, the kingdom sprang up after [[Goblin|goblins]] overwhelmed the young kingdom of Alban (modern-day [[Lambreth]]) and took its place as master of the region. Ruled over by barghests, the empire survived until 4217 AR when the Yellowtongue Sickness swept through the region, crippling the kingdom. It then fell to a loose coalition of adventurers, riverfolk, and [[Half-elf|half-elves]] that same year.

The [[Goblin|goblins]] of Zog left behind many pits, delves, and hidden cave complexes that have yet to be explored.
