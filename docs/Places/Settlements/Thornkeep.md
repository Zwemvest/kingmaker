# Thornkeep
The small town of Thornkeep is located within the [[Echo-Wood|Echo Wood]] of the northwestern [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]], about 10 miles east of the [[West-Sellen-River|West Sellen River]] and 100 miles northwest of [[Daggermark-Realm|Daggermark]] at the junction of the [[Mosswater]], Dagger, and Forest roads. Its reputation as a rowdy and dangerous settlement draws unscrupulous adventurers, [[bandits]], and entrepreneurs for many types of illicit trade.

The village of Thornkeep was the largest settlement in the previous [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdom]] of [[Mosswater]] when that town fell to merrow. It claims the former territory, but faces competition from the [[Hellknights|Hellknight]] settlement of Fort Inevitable, which patrols the [[River-Road|Crusader Road]]. Â 

Ostensibly a barony, Thornkeep operates more like a syndicracy. The baron's loyalists jostle for power against various mercenary companies, criminal gangs, and indigenous groups. Prominent mercenary companies include the martial Blue Basilisks, the arcane Goldenfire Order, and the rustic Hunters' Guild. The Three Daggers thieves' guild is Thornkeep's largest faction, but it faces
competition from newcomers, particularly a gang known as the Ironjaws. The Wolfmanes, a local [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords|Kellid]] tribe, share an uneasy peace with Thornkeep. [[Goblin|Goblins]]-remnants of the [[Kingdom-of-Zog|Kingdom of Zog]]-are prevalent in the forest, as well as in the town itself.

The large number of nearby ruins and monsters attracts many adventures looking to start making a name for themselves. This includes those interested in the nearby [[Emerald-Spire|Emerald Spire]].
