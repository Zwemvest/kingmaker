# Thornhold
The village of Thornhold was the largest settlement in the previous [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdom]] of [[Mosswater]] when that town fell to merrow. It claims the former territory, but faces competition from the [[Hellknights|Hellknight]] settlement of Fort Inevitable, which patrols the [[River-Road|Crusader Road]].
