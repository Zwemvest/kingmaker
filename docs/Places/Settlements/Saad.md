# Saad
The hamlet of Saad is notable as the home of [[Daggermark-Realm|Daggermark]]’s cavalry. The hamlet comprises two dozen large timber buildings surrounded by a motte-and-bailey with several tall timber towers that look out over the surrounding plains. Outside the hamlet proper are dozens of well-guarded horse farms. All of these horses are the interbred stock of the original Yenchabur stallions brought west in 4402 and are trained for war. Saad is also the primary trade center for all merchant traffic coming from [[Tymon-Realm|Tymon]], and as such is the most focused point of bandit aggression in Daggermark. The trade routes across this region are plagued by thievery, much more than the Daggermark cavalry can stop.
