# Mivon
[[Mivon-Realm|Mivon]] began as a refuge for [[Aldori-Swordlords|Aldori swordlords]] fleeing [[Rostland]] during the era of [[Choral-Rogarvia|Choral the Conqueror]]. Today, Mivon is home to a thriving industry in eels and fish harvested from the marshy ponds all around the city. It is said that the eels of Mivon often feed on the flesh of men. Certainly, the [[Aldori-Swordlords|swordlord]] Raston Selline, who rules the city under a guise of gentility but with a network of informers second to none, is sometimes seen walking out into the marshes with some petty miscreant or annoying adventurer and returning accompanied only by his faithful guards. “A walk to the fishponds” has a very particular meaning in Mivon.
