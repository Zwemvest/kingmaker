# Farhaven
Farhaven is the only decent town the [[Protectorate-of-the-Black-Marquis|protectorate]] has. It actually has a city guard numbering 20 or so, protected cattle pens and guarded farms, and some legitimate merchant traffic with other [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]]. Of course, itâ€™s still a pirate town, so it has the requisite black markets, bar fights, and docks crawling with scallywags, but of the [[Deadbridge|two towns]] of the [[Protectorate-of-the-Black-Marquis|protectorate]], on a good day Farhaven might actually be called a decent place to live.
