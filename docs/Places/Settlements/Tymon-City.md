# Tymon
The half-orc champion Ullorth Ungin, one of the most inf luential members of the Outlaw Council, controls the timeworn city-state of Tymon. Founded by a Taldan gladiator and hero of the Fifth Army of Exploration who mapped the riverways of the unsettled territory centuries ago, Tymon’s gladiatorial college and fabled arena enjoy a reputation that stretches into all lands that thrill to the dance of bloodsport. The insane “living god” Razmir hatches plots against Tymon from his expanding homeland to the southwest, increasingly forcing Ullorth Ungin to turn his trained warriors loose not on the arena floor, but upon the field of battle. Fortunately, a large cadre of priests of Gorum assists him in this endeavor. Each year, Ullorth Ungin pleads for “true champions of the Riverfolk” to step forward at the Outlaw Council to help him as well, and so far each year, various lordlings have pledged their support against Razmir, and the independence of the kingdoms has been preserved.
