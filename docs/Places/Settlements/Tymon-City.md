# Tymon
The half-orc champion Ullorth Ungin, one of the most inf luential members of the [[Outlaw-Council|Outlaw Council]], controls the timeworn [[Tymon-Realm|city-state of Tymon]]. Founded by a [[Taldor|Taldan]] gladiator and hero of the Fifth Army of Exploration who mapped the riverways of the unsettled territory centuries ago, Tymon’s gladiatorial college and fabled arena enjoy a reputation that stretches into all lands that thrill to the dance of bloodsport. The insane “living god” Razmir hatches plots against [[Tymon-Realm|Tymon]] from his expanding homeland to the southwest, increasingly forcing Ullorth Ungin to turn his trained warriors loose not on the arena floor, but upon the field of battle. Fortunately, a large cadre of priests of [[Gorum]] assists him in this endeavor. Each year, Ullorth Ungin pleads for “true champions of the [[River-Kingdoms|Riverfolk]]” to step forward at the [[Outlaw-Council|Outlaw Council]] to help him as well, and so far each year, various lordlings have pledged their support against Razmir, and the independence of the kingdoms has been preserved.
