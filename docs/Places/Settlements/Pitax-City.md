# Pitax
Ruled by the megalomaniacal [[King-Irovetti|King Irovetti]], Pitax is a place of garish, trashy art created by sculptors and poets tightly controlled by the city’s despot. As long as [[King-Irovetti|Irovetti]]’s massively bloated ego remains fed, all is well, but those who oppose him in the most trivial details soon learn that he sees himself as an all-conquering god. Underneath his mania, the small town struggles to survive in the face of hostility from [[Brevoy]] and borderland barbarian tribes of [[Numeria]]. Stories claim that [[King-Irovetti|Irovetti]] is himself little more than a bastard son of a minor [[Numeria|Numerian]] lord, hounded from the kingdom by ancestral enemies. He leaves the hard fighting to others, and prefers to use bards and insults to tear down his enemies.
