# Everbloom
The remote monastery of Everbloom cloisters quiet priests devoted to [[Milani]], the goddess of hope and devotion. In times of peace, they primarily serve as healers and counselors, manufacturing and selling rosewine to support themselves. More recently, [[Milani]]â€™s devotees have adopted a new cause, training as monks and embracing the rebellious aspects of their faith while they hide Queen Sovella and young Prince Edryd and prepare to overthrow Waike.
