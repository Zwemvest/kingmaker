# Uringen
Standing near the [[Embeth-Forest|Embeth Forest]], this strange settlement appears and disappears with the mists. Its travellers are distinctive, with black-and-white garments and unsmiling faces, and the alchemical goods sold are always welcome for their healing and strengthening properties. The people speak a dialect of Skald, and the city itself seems somehow suspended half in and half out of time, perhaps entangled in [[fey]] magic or trapped by horological magic.
