# Leydis
Leydis is a moss-covered ruined city located in the wood north of [[Rookwarden]] in the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]] region known as [[Loric-Fells|Loric Fells]]. It was founded by a [[Taldor|Taldan]] prospector who struck pay dirt nearby, but was abandoned soon after it was founded. Its marble buildings and water-stained mosaics, not to mention the wealth in the abandoned nearby mine, still attract creatures and adventurers, but no one has been able to claim it for more than a year. Those who enter the ruins often find the skeletons of their predecessors hanging from its walls. Leydis is currently held by the medusa Chryphaena and her blind zombies.
