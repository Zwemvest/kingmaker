# Solanas
Solanas is a frontier town through and through. Though it has a sheriff and a mayor, the true authority here is a coalition of citizens called the Solanas Concern, which constantly threatens assassination to get its way. The beleaguered sheriff does all he can to keep the peace, but the Concern—little more than a gang of criminals—stops him wherever he interferes with its interests. Crime in Solanas is rampant, with deaths or serious injuries just about every day. The mayor has an emissary in Daggermark, begging the new Lord Livondar for help, but so far the Solanas Concern seems to have full control of the town. Oddly, Solanas is home to a relatively large Pathfinder Society lodge, complete with a main hall, a dormitory, and a stable full of fresh horses. The lodge is guarded by mercenaries and sees regular traffic. Whatever the Society is doing in Solanas, it must be significant.
