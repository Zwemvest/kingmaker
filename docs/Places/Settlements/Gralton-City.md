# Gralton
The inhabitants of Gralton consist almost entirely of people who have fled the ongoing revolution (some would say anarchy) in [[Galt]]. Many of those who have fled to [[Gralton-Realm|Gralton]] are the old nobility of [[Galt]]. Deposed and fallen from grace, they desperately seek any means to regain what they have lost, be it by sponsoring counter-revolutionary activity, or sending parties of hapless adventurers back into [[Galt]] to search for family heirlooms left behind in the rush to escape the guillotine's blade. As the desperation of the deposed nobility grew, Gralton began to attract con-artists and tricksters. These tried to hustle the desperate nobility by offering quick fixes and false hope.
The town has two notable temples: one to the drunken hero deity, Cayden Cailean,the other to the Vengeful Sting, [[Calistria]]. In fact, many suspect the people of Gralton to be possessed by some spirit of [[Calistria]]. Certainly, the priests of [[Calistria]] are always present, preaching revenge, even on the steps of the temple of Cayden Cailean. So bent on vengeance against [[Galt]] are they, that many see divine intervention in their hate-filled eyes.
