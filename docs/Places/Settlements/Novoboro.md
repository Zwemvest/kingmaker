# Novoboro
Built long ago by [[Elf|elves]], this place lies behind a fortified stone wall on the riverside. It boasts a dozen buildings made of timber and a two-story stone tower overlooking the river, with keen-
eyed archers watching for approaching hostiles. The place is starting to become a neutral trading post, and painted markers or trees bearing the villageâ€™s tattered crow-banner mark the path to the village. The locals are superstitious about the many crows that nest here, and killing crows in town is a crime punishable by death.
