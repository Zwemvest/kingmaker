# Nivakata's Crossing
Nivakta's Crossing is a village at the very southern edge of [[Rostland]], protected by a wooden palisade wall surrounding it. The South [[Rostland]] Road runs through the village, as does the road leading to the newly established settlement at Varnhold. This place is home to trappers, anglers, hunters and tradesmen. The locals are a serious bunch and very suspicious of strangers especially those from the the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]].
