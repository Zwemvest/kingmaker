# Nivakata's Crossing
Nivakta's Crossing is a village at the very southern edge of [[Rostland]], protected by a wooden palisade wall surrounding it. The [[docs/Places/Place-of-Interest/South-Rostland-Road|South Rostland Road]] runs through the village. This place is home to trappers, anglers, hunters and tradesmen. The locals are a serious bunch and very suspicious of strangers especially those from the the [[../River-Kingdoms/Stolen-Lands.md|Stolen Lands]].
