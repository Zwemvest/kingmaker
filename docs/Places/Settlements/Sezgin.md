# Sezgin
Sezgin is a small town in the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdom]] of [[Lambreth]].

Sezgin was originally more of an elaborate chateau and hunting lodge than a town, attracting skilled hunters to its trackless thickets containing rare whitehorn deer and savage boars. It became notorious when the local lord, Igan Varklein, was discovered to be trafficking in humanoid slaves to hunt for his own and his patrons’ amusement. Outraged by Varklein’s defiance of the [[River-Freedoms|River Freedoms]], Marstead Vizcarra led a coup and installed himself as lord in 4424. With his personal wealth and family mercantile connections, he built and improved roads linking the villages of the area to the rest of [[Lambreth]], culminating in the building of the Raven Bridge across the Tolemaida in 4449 to make a permanent link to the [[Daggermark-Realm|Daggermark Road]]. Over the years, the Vizcarras set up tanneries outside the town and built up Sezgin’s reputation for fine leatherworking, as well as making it a center for the fur trade in river marten, otter, and beaver along the [[Tolemaida-River|Tolemaida]]’s tributaries and farther north into the unclaimed lands around [[Echo-Wood|Echo Wood]].
