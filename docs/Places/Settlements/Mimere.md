# Mimere
This village on the eastern bank of the [[Sellen-River|Sellen]] serves as a trading outpost and boasts a sturdy dock, several small shops, an inn, and an alehouse. River pirates have learned not to attack the seemingly helpless village, because at the smallest threat [[Elf|elven]] warriors descend from the trees like autumn leaves. This is widely known, for Hymbrian custom is to leave one would-be attacker alive to tell the tale, and to leave him with enough scars to convince any audience of his veracity. But for the most part, visitors f ind the [[Elf|elves]] to be friendly, even convivial, enjoying gossip from other kingdoms and delighting in music, dance, and stories. The alehouse is a lively place and the inn is clean and comfortable. Anyone who slips away from either during the night can expect to be followed by [[Elf|elves]] determined to ascertain motive and purpose and who are not particular about how they gather this information. The village has shrines to [[Calistria]], [[Desna]], Gozreh, and Nethys; no priest is assigned to look after the shrines, but the faithful in town leave offerings and keep the sites clean, relying on visiting clergy to deal with other spiritual matters.
