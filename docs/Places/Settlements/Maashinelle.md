# Maashinelle
In the lowlands where the Tolemaida joins the [[Sellen-River|Sellen River]] lies the town of Maashinelle, the largest settlement in [[Lambreth]] and seat of [[Kamdyn-Arnefax|Lord Arnefax]]. The town has a large dockside section along both rivers, including slips for boat building and repair as well as taprooms and inns catering to stopover traffic. Meanwhile, numerous smithies monopolized by [[Kamdyn-Arnefax|Lord Arnefax]] produce export-quality metalwork, from military ironmongery to prosaic necessities like pots and cutlery. 

The largest farms in [[Lambreth]] surround Maashinelle, including several fine vineyards and numerous ranches, and several trainers of dogs, falcons, and horses for use in the hunt or in battle reside nearby. Maashinelle’s most famous product is the marvelously soft wool loomed here, famous across [[Lake-Encarthan|Lake Encarthan]] as “Cullerton wool.” After the Cullertons’ exile, the shrewd Luana Laken began recruiting their former suppliers while she purchased their old looms from [[Kamdyn-Arnefax|Lord Arnefax]]. Within 2 decades, “Laken wool” had exceeded the prestige of its former name, and by 4698, Laken had built enough wealth and influence to be named mayor of Maashinelle.
