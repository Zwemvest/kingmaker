# Sarain
This town lies close to the border between [[Pitax-Realm|Pitax]] and [[Mivon-Realm|Mivon]], meaning that Sarain has changed hands from one kingdom to the other over a half-dozen times in the past 200 years. The reason for this is simpleâ€”whoever controls the village controls the wondrous vineyards that grow nearby. Many a border war has been fought between the two small kingdoms over these vineyards, as Sarain vintages are renowned throughout [[Avistan]]. Unfortunately, an unintended consequence of this constant fighting has been the vineyards' occasional destruction.
