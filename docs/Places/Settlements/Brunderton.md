# Brunderton
The mining town of Brunderton in eastern [[Rostland]] in [[Brevoy]] is home to a relatively large number of [[Dwarf|dwarves]] for the region. Most [[Dwarf|dwarves]] throughout southern [[Brevoy]] and the northern [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]] have relatives from here, and gem and ore traders from Brunderton can often be found peddling their wares along the [[Sellen-River|Sellen]]'s many tributaries.
