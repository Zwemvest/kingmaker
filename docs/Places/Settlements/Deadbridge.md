# Deadbridge
The heart of the [[Protectorate-of-the-Black-Marquis|protectorate]] is Deadbridge, a run-down old hamlet built nearly 50 years ago that was but an abandoned hovel when [[Morgan-the-White|Morgan the White]] settled here and established the [[Protectorate-of-the-Black-Marquis|protectorate]]. The pirate capital is made up of broken huts, shacks, and sheds in between which run foul, muddy streets filled with refuse and animal corpses—and sometimes two-legged ones as well. Most of today’s Deadbridge is built atop a wharf that extends far out into the [[Sellen-River|Sellen River]] atop ancient piles that were once part of a stone bridge some forgotten kingdom built here and then abandoned. The homes, buildings, and warehouses on the wharf are of the finest construction, and this is where the [[Urdul-Bazzak|Black Marquis]] resides when he’s in town. His most loyal men and women jealously guard the wharf, and anyone caught there who doesn’t belong is either cut down by swordplay or tied to barrels and drowned in the river.
