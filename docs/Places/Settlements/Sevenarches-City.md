# Sevenarches
This ancient [[Elf|elven]] settlement is named for the elegant stone gateways scattered in and around the forest town. Sevenarches is now a [[human]] habitation, and has been for thousands of years, since the sect of [[Oakstewards]] [[Sevenarches-Realm|claimed the land]] from the [[Elf|elves]] who failed it. Indeed, the [[Oakstewards]] especially forbid [[Elf|elves]] and other outsiders from visiting, and are quite strict in who and what they allow to approach [[Sevenarches-Realm|Sevenarches]]. Stories claim that the arches each once led to another world, and the [[Elf|elven]] council of [[Kyonin]] hopes to reclaim them and complete or restore the work begun on them long ago. So far, the [[Elf|elves]] remain unwilling to use force to oust the [[human]] presence there, but at some point the idea of war might carry the day, especially as the [[Oakstewards]] grow increasingly rigid and intolerant with each passing century.
