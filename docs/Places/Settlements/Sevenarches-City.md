# Sevenarches
This ancient [[Elf|elven]] settlement is named for the elegant stone gateways scattered in and around the forest town. Sevenarches is now a [[human]] habitation, and has been for thousands of years, since the sect of [[Oakstewards]] [[Sevenarches-Realm|claimed the land]] from the [[Elf|elves]] who failed it. Indeed, the [[Oakstewards]] especially forbid [[Elf|elves]] and other outsiders from visiting, and are quite strict in who and what they allow to approach [[Sevenarches-Realm|Sevenarches]]. Stories claim that the arches each once led to another world, and the [[Elf|elven]] council of [[Kyonin]] hopes to reclaim them and complete or restore the work begun on them long ago. So far, the [[Elf|elves]] remain unwilling to use force to oust the [[human]] presence there, but at some point the idea of war might carry the day, especially as the [[Oakstewards]] grow increasingly rigid and intolerant with each passing century.

The eponymous main settlement of Sevenarches has a wall, overgrown with ivy, and openings that lack gates. A remnant from the distant past, the wall is all but useless as a defensive structure and could never repel an assaulting army. The town itself is a creepy jumble of [[Elf|elven]] ruin and [[human]] architecture. Flora covers the city, and many streets are draped with resilient ivy thatch, springy to the touch, but thick enough to withstand heavy draft animals. Sevenarches is the first major stop for pilgrims and traders headed north on the [[Sellen-River|Sellen]]. The town is home to two bustling supply companies, Sellenmark Supply and Auldwell’s, two fiercely competitive shops that sell all major and minor adventuring necessities. 

In a cobblestone courtyard at the center of town, seven stone arches with subtly shifting colors stand in a circle, each 20 feet high, radiating faint illusion magic. These are reported to be magical [[Elf|elven]] arches that might serve as passage to the [[First-World|First World]] (though this actually is a lie; the [[Oakstewards]] assembled these arches and established this place as a diversion for onlookers wanting to study or use the true arches.) 

The mayor of Sevenarches, Esmet Silkenlock, is a reformed thief, a [[Kelesh|Keleshite]] from Katapesh made good in the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]]. Esmet is an indefatigable leader and administrator, overseeing as much of the town as possible, with the help of her staff of four. Having learned from the example of the Pactlords, she lets trade and travelers have a free hand. Chosen for the job by the [[Oakstewards]], Esmet has complete operational authority over town matters, except for the occasional [[Oakstewards|Oaksteward]] fiat (a state of affairs she finds annoying). 

The army of Sevenarches (which protects the entire kingdom as well as the town itself ) consists of about a thousand soldiers known as the Underbrush. Led by Captain Dethenesthen Carcusian, a disgraced former [[Taldor|Taldan]] envoy to [[Kyonin]], these defensive guerilla fighters rely heavily on [[Elf|elven]] skirmish tactics to demoralize and drive off enemies. Carcusian and 200 Underbrush soldiers are based in Sevenarches, but he regularly tours the territory with a retinue. 

But for the [[Oakstewards]], the violent vicissitudes of the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]] would overwhelm Esmet’s light touch and Carcusian’s small military. Leoti, the current [[Oakstewards#Voices|Voice of the Wind]], appears in town about once a week. A middle-aged [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords|Kellid]] woman with a world-weary demeanor, Leoti is friendly, but no-nonsense in dealing with outsiders. She loves to hear stories of happenings in [[Numeria]]. 

## Sellen River
The [[Sellen-River|great river]] comes within a mile of the city of Sevenarches, where caravans take merchants, mercenaries, and other travelers to the settlement. A direct walk to the city is discouraged, as the way is waterlogged, and marsh [[fey]] sometimes steal from travelers on foot. A gang of pixies working for the town accompanies each caravan, some invisible, some not. They use their detection spell-like abilities on anyone who looks remotely suspicious (which includes all adventurers), looking for sign of [[Elf|elves]] trying to sneak into the territory. Watery [[fey]] and the occasional water elemental also keep watch on the river, and usually report crossings to the [[Oakstewards]].
