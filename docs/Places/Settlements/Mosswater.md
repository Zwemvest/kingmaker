# Mosswater
The [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]] settlement of Mosswater was established as a quiet fishing retreat by an exiled [[Ustalav|Ustalavic]] merchant named Artoor Geera. Geera's apothecary discovered a valuable process for making luminous dyes from the unusual glowing plant life of the nearby Glow Water Lake.

In 4664 AR a tribe of merrow moved into the area and slaughtered the inhabitants of the village. The aquatic ogres have driven off all subsequent attempts to re-occupy the site and take advantage of the lucrative dye-making process.
