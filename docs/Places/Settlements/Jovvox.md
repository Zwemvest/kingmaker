# Jovvox
Jovvox is a largely [[Gnome|gnomish]] town east of the [[Mivon-City|city of Mivon]]. Originally built around a remote monastery by the enterprising [[gnome]] merchant Jov, Jovvox's weaponsmiths specialize in producing large quantities of cheap weapons, fast, thereby undercutting competition. Their raw materials come from a small nearby iron mine and from halfling and [[human]] scouts who also make Jovvox home and scavenge battlefields throughout the region for cast-offs that could be recycled. Kellywells, the current leader of the town, is known for crafting exotic, novel weapons.
