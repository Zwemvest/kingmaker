# Scrawny Crossing
The abandoned hamlet of Scrawny Crossing is in the western [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]]. It served as a ferry crossing and caravan stop until 4706 AR, when its inhabitants disappeared in mysterious circumstances.

All that remains of this realm is an abandoned ferry landing known as Scrawny Crossing—the site is now the lair of an unseen but sinister force.
