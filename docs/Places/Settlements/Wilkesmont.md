# Wilkesmont
The town of Wilkesmont is the former home of the [[Bandits|bandit]] lord Miklos Jakab, self-proclaimed ruler of the [[Shroudwood]] and the last serious [[Bandits|bandit]] threat to [[Daggermark-Realm|Daggermark]]. Though Jakab was killed in 4566, his followers swore fealty to Daggermark and now live on as a small protectorate of that city. Because of Wilkesmont’s past as a [[Bandits|bandit]] fortress and because of its location inside the [[Shroudwood]], relatively cut off from the rest of the Daggermark region, each time the Daggermark military falls apart, Wilkesmont suffers. The town has been burned to the ground three times, and each time rebuilt bigger than before. The town lacks any fortifications, instead relying on the heavy woods to keep most threats away. Recently, an uppity [[Bandits|bandit]] lord from [[Sevenarches-Realm|Sevenarches]] has been making noise about claiming the [[Shroudwood]] as his own. While this has the people of Wilkesmont on edge, they have several [[Daggermark-Assassins-Guild|assassins]] from Daggermark on retainer for just such an occasion.
