# Mormouth
The small hamlet of Mormouth, located in the northwest corner of Pitax, is a reluctant part of both the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]] and [[Pitax-Realm|Pitax]]. Tradition ties Mormouth to [[Pitax-City|Pitax]], but common sense and a desire for gold and other finer things in life edge it ever closer to [[Numeria]], its stronger neighbor. Mormouth was founded not long after the establishment of Pitax as an actual kingdom. Beginning as a humble fishing outpost, the hamlet remained a sleepy, unassuming place for many years. When Pitax underwent a great period of civil unrest a mere hundred years ago, and split into the rival kingdoms of [[Pitax-Realm|Pitax]] and [[Corvenn]], Mormouth found itself in [[Corvenn]], which allied with [[Numeria]]. When [[Corvenn]] merged back into [[Pitax-Realm|Pitax]] a few decades later, all of the [[Numeria]]-based prestige and affluence gained by the people of Mormouth vanished, transforming the bustling town back into a simple fishing village. Some welcomed this change, but many others did not. Now the residents of Mormouth are strongly divided on the issue of where their true loyalties lie, enough so that violent unrest has been known to spill out onto its streets over the matter.
