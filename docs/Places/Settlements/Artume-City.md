# Artume
Plagued by assassinations and treachery, [[Artume-Realm|Artume]] is a kingdom without a king. Only unexpected luck or the aid of a powerful new patron can save this realm from becoming the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]]’ most recent failure.  

By far the kingdom’s largest settlement, Artume bears its founder’s name and still stands as a testament to his martial spirit. The defensible white walls and towers of Gildtmede Keep rise from feldspar cliffs overlooking the [[Sellen-River|Sellen River]] and surrounding plains. Below the city, [[Gnome|gnomes]] maintain a warren of tunnels and excavated caverns leading to waterwheels whose gears power hoists capable of raising and lowering cargo for arriving barges. As a result, many view the otherwise unreachable vaults within the connecting caverns as the most secure storehouse for trade goods along the entire river valley.
