# Liberthane
A glimmer of hope and idealism in the cutthroat milieu of the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]], Liberthane is ruled by an old revolutionary who hopes, one day, to save his homeland of [[Galt]]. Â 

Liberthane was once a rundown bandit fortress in the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]] until it was taken over by [[Achille-Parsall|Achille Parsall]], an aristocrat of [[Galt]] who is also a paladin of Milani.

It is the base from which Parsall seeks to recruit for his cause. In the long term, this is freedom for [[Galt]]; in the shorter term he seeks to unify the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]]. The hamlet serves as a bastion of idealism in the sometimes cut-throat society of the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]], but all who live there are expected to follow the orders of Parsall and his soldiers.
