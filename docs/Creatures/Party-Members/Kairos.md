# Kairos
Ancient-[[Elf]] Magus

### TLDR
Ancient Elf. Has travelled the land for a long time, so long that even she can't remember. Fascinated by everything Arcana. Analytical, strategic thinker, takes on a mentor role. Has trouble understanding the quick-changing customs of the faster-lived races. 
### Backstory
Kairos has travelled the Inner Sea region for at least the last 100 years, but likely longer. She's a scholar dedicated to understanding the weave of magic and time, and her studies have led her to ancient texts that allow her to navigate different currents of time. 

Kairos is cautious and highly analytical, preferring to observe and assess situations before taking action. She avoids taking the spotlight, often working from the shadows or the background to gather information and devise strategies. This approach extends to her social interactions, where she carefully considers her words and actions.

She's a powerful mage, more powerful than she may seem at first glance, but also takes care to hide much of her knowledge of magic. She relies almost completely on a few simple spells to throw people off-guard, and maintains an anonymous persona so that knowledge of her fighting style doesn't become wide-spread. 

Kairos knows a lot about clockwork and crafting, having learned the magic from the gnomes of Uringen. 
### Hook
A few months ago, she was hired by the [[Brevoy]] noble house of [[Brevoy-Nobility#Labeda|Lebeda]]. [[Leonardo|Leonardo]]'s android body had some failing parts and the family needed a capable mechanic that could also keep her mouth shut. His parents also hired [[Djames]] to hunt for adamantine, which indirectly caused [[Djames]] to poison a forest and later meet [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy the Leshby]]. 

When months later [[Leonardo|Leonardo]] was invited to join the expedition to the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]], his parent's decided it would be beneficial if there was also a mechanic inventor with intimate knowledge of the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]]. 

She's personally interested in travelling around because she's noticed temporal inconsistencies around the Stolen Lands - especially where Djames has been. She's not trying to fix this - it's more out of curiosity. 
### Appearance
She looks around the age of 18-20, but this is simply thanks to her magic and because she's an elf. Her social clumsiness can sometimes confuse shorter-lived races into thinking she's genuinely a young, unexperienced rookie.  

She has purple hair, and fights with a whip-like weapon, which she uses to deliver spells. 

Kairos had an accident when [[Uringen-City|Uringen]] was first teleported away - missing her heart, her leg, and her arm. The local [[Gnome|gnomish]] engineers of Uringen saved her by replacing the missing parts of her body by clockwork parts. 
### Social style
She avoids taking the spotlight, often working from the shadows or the background to gather information and devise strategies. This approach extends to her social interactions, where she carefully considers her words and actions.

In conversations, Kairos listens more than she speaks, absorbing information and considering various angles before contributing. When she does offer her opinion, it is well thought out and insightful, often revealing a depth of understanding that others might have missed.

She avoids unnecessary risks and prefers to have contingency plans in place. This cautious approach can sometimes make her appear overly conservative or hesitant, but it also means she is rarely caught off guard.

Kairos's analytical nature extends to her relationships. She carefully assesses the motives and behaviors of those around her, choosing her allies and confidants with great care. This sometimes makes her seem distant or aloof, but those who earn her trust find her to be a deeply loyal and reliable companion.
### Fighting style
In battle, Kairos's analytical mindset truly shines. She meticulously studies her enemies and the battlefield, analysing their strengths, weaknesses, and patterns of behaviour. Rather than rushing into the fray, she holds back, conserving her mana and energy for the opportune moment. She will often appear passive or detached, giving her allies the impression that she is either disinterested or not fully engaged.

However, this is far from the truth. Kairos's mind is constantly calculating, waiting for the precise moment to strike. When she does act, it is with singular precision and devastating effectiveness. She unleashes well-aimed, powerful spells that target key weaknesses or turn the tide of battle in her favor. Her attacks are carefully chosen to maximize impact while minimizing expenditure, reflecting her deep understanding of magical efficiency.

### Relations
- Kairos has helped fix up [[Leonardo|Leonardo]]'s systems, and has now been asked by his family to join him in the expedition to the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]]
- Kairos vaguely knows [[Djames]], as [[Leonardo|Leonardo]]'s parents have hired [[Djames]] for adamantine to help fix up [[Leonardo|Leonardo]]. Djames' magic works by lying, and his lies sometimes causes inconsistencies in the time stream. Kairos knows the timelines seem to change whenever Djames talks, but nobody else seems to notice. Kairos is sometimes bewildered by Djames' laissez-fair methodology around casting spells. 
- Kairos has no ties to [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]], and only met [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] at the first meeting for the expedition to the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]]

### Behavior 
Kairos will act as follows; 
- **Analytical:** Kairos embodies is a strategic thinker, always one step ahead due to her deeply ingrained analytical mindset. She approaches every situation, whether mundane or perilous, with a methodical and calculated perspective. 
- **Scholarly:** She is far older than the rest of the party and has a long history in studying magic and spells, giving her a scholarly disposition. She will often explain or lecture to people (especially about magic and history!). She shows a mix of strictness and genuine care, often over-explaining magical theories and techniques.
- **Mentor:** Though she's reluctant to give advice, she will take on a mentorly role with the people she trusts. She is fiercely protective of her party members, stepping into danger to shield them or offering unsolicited advice on how to handle threats. This protective instinct extends to any perceived weakness or vulnerability in others.
- **Social clumsiness:** Despite her travels, Kairos has spent fairly little time among the shorter-lived races. Kairos can be socially awkward, misunderstanding jokes, or failing to recognize when she’s overstepping boundaries. Her interactions with shorter-lived races are particularly clumsy, as she struggles to relate to their experiences.
- **Future Sight:** Thanks to her magic, Kairos can sometimes see a little bit into the future or into different timelines. This is inconsistent, and she knows she can't really rely on this ability to meaningfully shape a future into being. Occasionally, Kairos will make cryptic comments or predictions about the future, reflecting her inconsistent glimpses into what lies ahead.
- **Respect for magic:** Kairos treats magic with the utmost respect, considering it a precise and noble art. She disapproves of careless or reckless spellcasting, often reprimanding those who do not share her disciplined approach. Kairos is cautious when people have amateurish or dangerous attitudes around magic. For her, it's an exact science that should be treated with respect. 
- **Spell collector:** collects spells, spell books, and magic artefacts as a hobby. She can display an intense focus on her interests, sometimes even at the expense of current tasks or missions.
