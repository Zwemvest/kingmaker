# Kairos
Ancient-[[Elf]] Magus

Kairos is an [[elf]] with a clockwork heart. She remembers being half-left behind when [[Uringen-City|Uringen]] teleported away - missing her heart, her leg, and her arm. The local [[Gnome|gnomish]] engineers of Uringen saved her by replacing the missing parts of her body by clockwork parts. 

Kairos has no real memories of who she was before her accident. She sometimes still blinks in between timelines and has memories of events in the far past or in the future yet to happen, but can't really distinct if these memories are actually her own. 

Ever since, she's wandered the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]], looking for a way to retrieve her original parts. All she knows is that she has to go back to the [[First-World|First World]]. 

A few months ago, she was hired by the [[Brevoy]] noble house of [[Brevoy-Nobility#Labeda|Lebeda]]. [[Leonardo|Leonardo]]'s android body had some failing parts and the family needed a capable mechanic that could also keep her mouth shut. His parents also hired [[Djames]] to hunt for adamantine, which indirectly caused [[Djames]] to poison a forest and later meet [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy the Leshby]].

When months later [[Leonardo|Leonardo]] was invited to join the expedition to the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]], his parent's decided it would be beneficial if there was also a mechanic inventor with intimate knowledge of the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]]. 

- Kairos has helped fix up [[Leonardo|Leonardo]]'s systems, and has now been asked by his family to join him in the expedition to the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]]
- Kairos vaguely knows [[Djames]], as [[Leonardo|Leonardo]]'s parents have hired [[Djames]] for adamantine to help fix up [[Leonardo|Leonardo]]
- Kairos has no ties to [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]], and only met [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] at the first meeting for the expedition to the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]]




Kairos lost parts of her history and memories in Uringen Unstuck and has ever since wandered the River Kingdoms. Before losing her history, she was a simple smith, but Kairos remembers little from her time as a smith, even though crafting still comes natural to her as a talent. She is fairly confused by her memory, as she remembers a lot of historical events she wasn't present for, never happened, are yet to happen or from a future that will never happen. 

Kairos now believes she is destined for greatness, a heroic saviour of the world. For Kairos, this fate is more cruel than heroic - She thinks she's part of the dragon-slayers, leaders of the rebellion, and those arrogant enough to seek out power.

Kairos will act as follows; 
- Know whatâ€™s best for everyone else (except party members, who she also considers to be great heroic saviours).
- Be a guardian or protector, even when there's nothing to be guarded or protected
- Present a perfect persona to the world. 
- Declare someone or something fundamentally good or irredeemably evil.
