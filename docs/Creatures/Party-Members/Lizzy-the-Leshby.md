# Lizzy the Leshby
Half-[[Elf]] Leshy Witch (Wildling Steward)

[[Djames]] is Lizzy's best \<placeholder\>. As far as you ask Lizzy, [[Djames]] always speaks the truth. 

Lizzy has a raccoon named [[Gomi]]. 

Lizzy is a very young Leshy, having only existed for the last year. She has a half-[[elf]] body, but seems to behave as if she has no memory of her half-elf past, seemingly fully a Leshy. She is erratic, and trusts Djames through thick and thin.
