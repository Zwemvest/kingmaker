# Djames Sailor
[[Human]] Bard

Djames is a former official from a major city [[Galt]]. A major fire broke out and not enough people were present to extinguish it, causing a major revolt. Djames was almost executed, but managed to escape to [[Brevoy]]

[[Djames]] was later hired by Lord [[Lander-Lebeda|Lander Lebeda]] to hunt for adamantine, which was intended as a material to repair [[Djames]], essential for [[Kairos]]. In doing so, he poisoned and endangered a forest near [[Galt]] and the [[Broken-Lands|Broken Lands]]. This would later lead to the creation of [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy the Leshby]], and [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] and Djames still travel together. [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] admires Djames, and thinks he'd never ever lie to [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]].

They have now joined [[Kairos]], [[Djames]] for the expedition to the [[Broken-Lands|Broken Lands]]

[[Kairos]] has heard rumors that Djames stole all the money from the fire brigade in [[Galt]].
