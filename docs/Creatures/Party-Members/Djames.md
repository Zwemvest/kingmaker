# Djames
Human Bard

Djames stole all the money from the fire brigade in [[Galt]]. A major fire broke out and not enough people were present to extinguish it, causing a major revolt. Djames was almost executed, but managed to escape to [[Brevoy]]

[[Djames]] was later hired by Lord Lander Lebeda to hunt for adamantine, which was intended as a material to repair [[Djames]], essential for [[Kairos]]. In doing so, he poisoned and endangered a forest near [[Galt]] and the [[Broken-Lands|Broken Lands]]. This would later lead to the creation of [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy the Leshby]], and Lizzy and Djames still travel together. Lizzy admires Djames, and thinks he'd never ever lie to Lizzy.

They have now joined [[Kairos]], [[Djames]] for the expedition to the [[Broken-Lands|Broken Lands]]
