# Leonardo Lebeda
Android Oracle

Age: 22

He know an entire load of languages, and seems to effortlessly switch between them.

Might be autistic.

He was locked up for his entire youth to study, by his parents.

Leonardo is a younger son of the [[Brevoy-Nobility#Lebeda|Lebeda]] family. His family has sent him away to join in on the expedition to the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]]. 

Leonardo has had a tragic accident a few years ago, when he was 18, and had to be transformed into an android to rescue him. The magical inventor who saved Leonardo went missing 1.5 years ago, and he needed a capable magical crafter who would keep their mouth shut about one of the Lebeda sons being an android.

Hence, 1.5 years Lord Lander Lebeda hired [[Kairos]] to repair Leonardo, and asked [[Djames]] to hunt for the adamantine needed to repair the internal android systems. Djames stole the adamantine out of a forest near Galt and the Stolen Lands.

- [[Kairos]] has helped fix up Leonardo's system and now joined him in the expedition into the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]].
- Leonardo considers [[Djames]] as an uncle. [[Djames]] is Leonardo's father's (Lord Lander Lebeda) lover and confidant.
- Leonardo only met [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] during the first meeting organized by [[Jamandi-Aldori|Jamandi Aldori]]
