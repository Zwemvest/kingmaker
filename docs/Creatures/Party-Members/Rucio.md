# Rucio
Rucio is the party's loyal and dependable pack mule. Rucio is a sturdy and patient animal, essential to our travels troughout the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]]. Despite his loyalty and resilience, Rucio is quick to panic in battle, and flees at the first sign. 

Rucio was named by [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]]. His name means "Grey" in some faraway dead Golarian language. 

Rucio can carry 18 bulk in weight: any bulk below 1 is treated as L-bulk (meaning: A Large creature treats 10 items of 1 Bulk as 1 Bulk). Any actual L bulk is treated as negligble.
