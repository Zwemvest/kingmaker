# History
Achille Parsall is the scion of one of [[Galt]]’s oldest noble families. As with many [[Galt|Galtan]] lords, Achille was sent to study in [[Andoran]]; when revolution broke out, Achille wanted to return and do his part. His parents, concerned by the tone of the street rhetoric, ordered him to remain where he was.

Parsall joined [[Andoran]]’s own revolt and became one of its most passionate advocates. When a baron refused citizenship and barricaded himself in his castle, Parsall led the charge that breached the walls and took the castle. The baron refused to surrender, and Achille slew him in the courtyard as his comrades cheered him on. This made Achille a hero of the revolt.

Parsall remained in [[Andoran]] until the new state had been firmly established. Then he returned to [[Galt]], hoping he could bring some of that stability to his homeland. He wanted liberty but found tyranny, sought freedom but found terror. His parents and siblings had been guillotined, and mobs ruled the streets. He stayed in [[Galt]] and tried to build a power bloc of like-minded citizens, but most of the moderates were already dead or in exile. After surviving several assassination attempts, he reluctantly left [[Galt]] with his few followers and headed back to [[Andoran]].

Revolution turned into politics; Parsall despaired for [[Galt]] and for the cause of liberty, until he was inspired by a fiery speech from a cleric of Milani, who spoke of the power of hope and the struggle for freedom. Achille pledged himself to the church of Milani and left [[Andoran]] forever. He spent the next 20 years championing oppressed people everywhere. As he moved into middle age, however, he realized he could not lead with his sword forever, and his homeland of [[Galt]] still suffered. This led him to the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]], where he could light a beacon of liberty near [[Galt]] and do what he could to save his homeland. He led a score of followers into the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]] and seized a rundown fortress from a notorious bandit. Renaming the place [[Liberthane]], he began recruiting young idealists to his cause, swearing to free [[Galt]] or die trying.
