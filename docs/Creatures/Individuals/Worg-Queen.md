# Worg Queen
The Worg Queen is a murderous [[goblin]] who, in 4669 AR, organized an army of bugbears, [[Goblin|goblins]], and worgs to make war on the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdom]] of [[Loric-Fells|Loric Fells]]'s outpost known as [[Rookwarden]], and its outlying hills, known as [[Rookwarden]] Fells.

The raid was a success: the group of monsters destroyed nearly every [[human]] settlement within ten miles of [[Rookwarden]]. It would be nearly a full [[human]] generation before the region would be reclaimed by [[Human|humans]].

The Worg Queen was driven out of [[Rookwarden]] by a coven of green hags, former allies who leveraged their control of a half dozen troll tribes to defeat their former mistress.
