# Stag Lord
The Stag Lord is a notorious bandit leader who rules over a gang of ruthless outlaws in the Stolen Lands, a wild and untamed region. The Stag Lord is known for his brutality and strategic cunning, making him a formidable foe for anyone attempting to bring order to the area.

The Stag Lord is a fearsome figure, often seen wearing a distinctive helmet adorned with stag antlers, which contributes to his intimidating presence and his nickname. Most bandits have never seen him without his stag helmet on, and some rumour that he doesn't even have a face under the helmet, or that his helmet _is_ his face. His true identity and backstory are shrouded in mystery, and most of his lackeys only seem to know little detail about his past. 

The Stag Lord is powerful, but particularly notorious for being deadly with a bow. Rumours go that he can crush bones with a single hand. 

He commands a large band of bandits and outlaws who terrorize the region, engaging in raids, extortion, and other criminal activities. The Stag Lord's bandits are loyal to him, partly out of fear and partly due to the spoils they gain from their exploits. Because it's hard to keep track of who works for the Stag Lord, his bandits sometimes use a password; ‘By the bloody bones of Saint Gilmorg, who wants to know?’ 

In recent years, the Stag Lord has turned to the bottle. His drunkness means he's not half of who or what he used to be, and has turned into a irrational leader. Rumours go that he recently punched a horse for spitting. This has shaken the loyalty of a lot of his bandits - but even drunk out of his mind, a lot of his bandits still fear him.
