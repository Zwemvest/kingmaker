# Stag Lord
The Stag Lord is a notorious [[Bandits|bandit]] leader who rules over a gang of [[Stag-Lord-Bandits|ruthless outlaws]] in the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]], a wild and untamed region. The Stag Lord is known for his brutality and strategic cunning, making him a formidable foe for anyone attempting to bring order to the area.

The Stag Lord is a fearsome figure, often seen wearing a distinctive helmet adorned with stag antlers, which contributes to his intimidating presence and his nickname. Most of the [[Stag-Lord-Bandits|Stag Lord's Bandits]] have never seen him without his stag helmet on, and some rumour that he doesn't even have a face under the helmet, or that his helmet _is_ his face. His true identity and backstory are shrouded in mystery, and most of his lackeys only seem to know little detail about his past. 

The Stag Lord is powerful, but particularly notorious for being deadly with a bow. Rumours go that he can crush bones with a single hand. He is a skilled fighter with abilities that make him a challenging opponent in combat.

He commands a large band of [[bandits]] and outlaws who terrorize the region, engaging in raids, extortion, and other criminal activities. The [[Stag-Lord-Bandits|Stag Lord's Bandits]] are loyal to him, partly out of fear and partly due to the spoils they gain from their exploits. Because it's hard to keep track of who works for the Stag Lord, the [[Stag-Lord-Bandits|Stag Lord's Bandits]] sometimes use a password; ‘By the bloody bones of Saint Gilmorg, who wants to know?’ 

In recent years, the Stag Lord has turned to the bottle. His drunkness means he's not half of who or what he used to be, and has turned into a irrational leader. Rumours go that he recently punched a horse for spitting. This has shaken the loyalty of a lot of the [[Stag-Lord-Bandits|Stag Lord's Bandits]]  - but even drunk out of his mind, a lot of the [[Stag-Lord-Bandits|Stag Lord's Bandits]] still fear him. 

He operates from a fortified base known as the [[Stag-Lords-Fort|Stag Lord's Fort]], which is heavily defended and strategically positioned. The fort serves as a central hub for his operations and a place where he stores his loot.
