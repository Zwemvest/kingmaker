# Svetlana Leveton
A kind and honest woman. She is married to [[Oleg-Leveton|Oleg Leveton]], and together they run [[Olegs-Trading-Post|Oleg's Trading Post]], where they provide a modest trading service and a place for travellers to rest their weary bodies.

Svetlana is a beautiful woman, with smooth skin and long, braided hair. She dresses modestly, and speaks softly, giving off a friendly aura to any who enter her vicinity. She is described as "hardy- she's definitely done some physical labour in her life, but her smile is kind" when she's first introduced.

Svetlana is mild-mannered and approachable. She never raises her voice other than to call for [[Oleg-Leveton|Oleg]] when he's in the next room. She practically radiates kindness to those around her, and is always quick to ensure her companions are comfortable, well-fed and content. She's also the only one [[Oleg-Leveton|Oleg]] ever really listens to.
