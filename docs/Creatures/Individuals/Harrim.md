# Harrim
Harrim is a [[Dwarf|dwarven]] cleric of the god [[Groetus]], a deity associated with the end times and oblivion. Harrim is known for his grim demeanor, fatalistic outlook on life, and dedication to his deity. He often expresses nihilistic beliefs and a fascination with death and destruction.

We met him during the start of the [[The-expedition-for-the-Stolen-Lands|Expedition for the Stolen Lands]]. He didn't take a particular liking to anyone. [[Kairos]] tried to impress him with knowledge of [[Groetus]], but he was not impressed. [[Leonardo|Leonardo]] was particularly stand-offish towards Harrim, but Harrim mostly ignored his antics.

He was captured in battle with [[Amiri]] and [[Valerie]] by a [[Giants#Frost Giants|Frost Giant]]. [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] would later negotiate a parlay between the Frost Giant, and the party plus Harrim, [[Valerie]], and [[Amiri]]. [[Harrim]] was pragmatic about this deal, and didn't particularly seem to care that the party let a [[Giants#Frost Giants|Frost Giant]] go. 
### Likely party attitude:
