# Maldar Tymon
Maldar Tymon was a famous [[Taldor|Taldan]] gladiator who is best remembered for having founded the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdom]] of [[Tymon-Realm|Tymon]] in 2021 AR.

Maldar was a well-known gladiator during the early 21st century AR in his hometown of Oppara, where he competed at the Oppara Arena. Feeling that he needed a greater challenge, Maldar assembled a group of his fellow gladiators and joined the Fifth Army of Exploration, helping to conquer the area today known as the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]]. In return for his service, he was given a large stretch of land that included much of the Exalted Wood and a mandate to rule that land in the name of [[Taldor]]. Maldar and his companions accepted this challenge and founded the town of [[Tymon-City|Tymon]] and began taming the local wilderness.
