# Ullorth Ungin
The [[half-orc]] champion Ullorth Ungin, one of the most influential members of the [[Outlaw-Council|Outlaw Council]], controls the shopworn city-state of [[Tymon-Realm|Tymon]], a short distance from the intrigues of [[Daggermark-Realm|Daggermark]]. Founded by a [[Taldor|Taldoran]] gladiator and hero of the Fifth Army of Exploration that mapped the riverways of the unsettled territory dozens of centuries ago, Tymon’s gladiator colleges and fabled arena enjoy a reputation that stretches into all lands that thrill to the dance of bloodsport. The insane “living god” [[Razmir]] hatches plots against Tymon from his expanding homeland to the southwest, forcing Ullorth Ungin to consider turning his trained warriors loose not on the arena floor, but upon the field of battle. Fortunately, a large cadre of priests of [[Gorum]] assists him in this endeavor, and each year, Ullorth Ungin pleads for “true champions of the [[River-Kingdoms|Riverfolk]]” to step forward at the [[Outlaw-Council|Outlaw Council]] to help him. For a wonder, each year, some lordling or another pledges his support against [[Razmir]], and the independence of the kingdoms is preserved.
