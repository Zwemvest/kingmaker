# Happs Bydon
Happs Bydon is a [[Bandits|bandit]] who tormented [[Olegs-Trading-Post|Oleg's Trading Post]] and [[Oleg-Leveton|its proprietors]]. Happs is a greasy, athletic figure. With a short trimmed beard and patchy, leather clothes, he's every inch the image of a [[Bandits|bandit]] goon. Happs is an overconfident, foul-mouthed figure that thoroughly enjoyed his role of a [[Bandits|bandit]]. In combat, Happs would often shout out boasts and vicious threats that he could not actually conceivably actually go through with.
## [[Session-1#1 Pharast 4710|1 Pharast 4710]]
During the [[Bandit-attack-on-Olegs-Trading-Post|Bandit attack on Oleg's Trading Post]], he was captured as the only surviving [[Bandits|bandit]].

\- Is a [[Bandits|bandit]], unwilling to work with pesky adventurers 
\- Captured me in a pit trap
\- Did not like interrogation
