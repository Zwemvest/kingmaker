Tartuccio is a witty [[gnome]] wizard encountered during the [[Grand-Banquet-at-Aldori-Manor|Grand Banquet]] at [[Aldori-Manor|Aldori Manor]]. Known for his sharp tongue and clever remarks, Tartuccio engages in conversation with other attendees, including [[Amiri]], a [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords|Kellid]] barbarian. Throughout the event, Tartuccio makes snide comments, particularly directed at [[Amiri]]'s perceived lack of manners, showcasing a sarcastic and condescending demeanor.
