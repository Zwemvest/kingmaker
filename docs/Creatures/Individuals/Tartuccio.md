# Tartuccio
Tartuccio is a witty [[gnome]] wizard encountered during the [[Grand-Banquet-at-Aldori-Manor|Grand Banquet]] at [[Aldori-Manor|Aldori Manor]]. Known for his sharp tongue and clever remarks, Tartuccio engages in conversation with other attendees, including [[Amiri]], a [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords|Kellid]] barbarian. Throughout the event, Tartuccio makes snide comments, particularly directed at [[Amiri]]'s perceived lack of manners, showcasing a sarcastic and condescending demeanor.

He was disappointed during the [[Grand-Banquet-at-Aldori-Manor|Grand Banquet]] to be seated near [[Amiri]] and constantly made mean comments about her manners. The party didn't engage on these comments.

During the [[Attack-on-Lady-Jamandi-Aldoris-Manor|Attack on Lady Jamandi Aldori's Manor]], we found him on the floor, unconscious. Lizzy was so kind as to help him regain his consciousness, but he immediately started making expectations that the party should help him to the guards under  [[Ivenzi]]. When Lizzy tried to do so, she accidentally hurt him a bit, after which he went off to complain. 

When he found the party, he again demanded that they'd treat him like their boss. The party refused and left him on his own. [[Leonardo]] tried to prevent him from leaving, while [[Kairos]] played a prank on him.
