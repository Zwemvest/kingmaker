# Knavar Mieren
Knavar Mieren is the mayor of the static part of [[Uringen-City|Uringen]], also serving as the protector of the nearby encampments as part of [[Uringen-Realm|Uringen]]. Uringen unstuck is ruled by [[Aurelia-Ogden|Lady Ogden]].

Both mayors meet once a year prior to the [[Outlaw-Council|Outlaw Council]] to determine who will represent the kingdom. This decision, although prefaced by debate and attempts at guile, more often than not falls to a game of chance such as dice or cards. As keepers of mysterious knowledge regarding the townâ€™s condition, the two mayors do not need to leverage violent abuse or tyrannical control over their citizens. Most people reside within Uringen to take part in the potion and alchemical trade, f ind a tolerable place to start a new life, or hide from an existing one.
