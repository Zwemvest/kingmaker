# Noleski Surtova
King Noleski Surtova is [[Brevoy]]'s current ruler. He has reigned over the divided nation since 4699 AR, when King Urzen Rogarvia, along with all members of House Rogarvia, mysteriously disappeared in an event known as the Vanishing.

Prior to taking the Dragonscale Throne in New Stetven, Surtova ruled Port Ice, as have members of House Surtova for more than a thousand years
