# Noleski Surtova
King Noleski [[Brevoy-Nobility#Surtova|Surtova]] is [[Brevoy]]'s current ruler. He has reigned over the divided nation since 4699 AR, when King Urzen [[Brevoy-Nobility#Rogarvia|Rogarvia]], along with all members of [[Brevoy-Nobility#Rogarvia|House Rogarvia]], mysteriously disappeared in an event known as the Vanishing.

Prior to taking the Dragonscale Throne in New Stetven, [[Brevoy-Nobility#Surtova|House Surtova]] ruled Port Ice, as have members of [[Brevoy-Nobility#Surtova|House Surtova]] for more than a thousand years.
