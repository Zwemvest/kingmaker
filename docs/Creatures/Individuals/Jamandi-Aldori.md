# Jamandi Aldori
Jamandi [[Aldori-Swordlords|Aldori]], [[Aldori-Swordlords|Swordlord]] of [[Restov]], is a famed [[half-elf]] practitioner of the [[Aldori-Swordlords|Aldori]] school of dueling. She heavily advocates for [[Restov]] to expand their power to reduce, or even eliminate, their dependence on [[Brevoy]].

Jamandi Aldori's upbringing in [[Restov]] could have ensured her a safe and relaxed life as one of that city's nobles, but her restlessness and frustration with “meddling” from the north increasingly pushed her away from the aristocratic lifestyle. She quickly mastered the art of the Aldori sword, and over the years has become one of [[Restov]]'s most well-known [[Aldori-Swordlords|swordlords]], in part due to her skill in dueling, but of late as a result of her increasingly obvious pushes to expand [[Restov]]'s power in directions that minimize reliance upon the rest of [[Brevoy]]. Beyond organizing the push into the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]] and her desire to foster a new ally to the south, she hopes some day to found additional dueling schools beyond [[Brevoy]]'s borders where the Aldori style can be taughta pursuit that not all of her peers equally approve of.

Jamandi Aldori is the current [[Aldori-Swordlords|Swordlord]] of [[Restov]] of the [[Aldori-Swordlords|Aldori Swordlords]] in [[Brevoy]], and a major leader of the separatist movement. She is well-acquainted with the Restovic gentry and has an adopted son named Kassil who she has trained in the sword. 

During her youth, Jamandi was involved in an ill-fated mission to the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]] to dispose of a [[Bandits|bandit]] gang. Although the group succeeded in uprooting the gang and killing it's monstrous leader, most of the group died with Jamandi and Ezvanki Keeg being the only survivors.

As their leader, a Paladin nobleman who was to claim the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]], fell during their mission the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]] was left unclaimed and subsequently fell back into banditry. 

## [[Session-0#24 Calistril 4710|24 Calistril 4710]]
Together with her close ally [[Ioseph-Sellemius|Ioseph Sellemius]], she organized a great banquet at [[Aldori-Manor|Aldori Manor]] to seek contenders for a baron title in an [[The-expedition-for-the-Stolen-Lands|Expedition for the Stolen Lands]]. The party was present at this banquet, but did not get the opportunity to speak to her. 
## [[Session-1#25 Calistril 4710|25 Calistril 4710]]
During the [[Attack-on-Lady-Jamandi-Aldoris-Manor|Attack on Lady Jamandi Aldori's Manor]], she gathered her guards under the collamd of [[Ivenzi]], and commanded them to find survivors and remain and secure the great hall. In the meantime, she'd venture into the West Wing to confront the [[Black-Tears|Black Tears]] [[bandits]] who had infiltrated Aldori Mansion. Lady Jamandi engaged in a battle, facing off against the adversaries threatening her home. Amidst the chaos, she single-handedly vanquished two Frost [[Giants]], though with a little help from [[Djames]] who command a Frost Giant to drop his weapons. 

While Lady Jamandi confronted the Frost [[Giants]], the party focused their efforts on dealing with the leader of the attackers, [[Volodmyra]].
