# Ivenzi
Ivenzi is the Captain of the Guard at [[Aldori-Manor|Aldori Manor]], employed by [[Jamandi-Aldori|Lady Jamandi]] Aldori. Ivenzi is described as a tall man with grey eyes, short black hair, prominent eyebrows, and a short mustache. 
## [[Session-1#25 Calistril 4710|25 Calistril 4710]]
During the [[Attack-on-Lady-Jamandi-Aldoris-Manor|Attack on Lady Jamandi Aldori's Manor]], the party finds him and several other guards in the great hall. The guards have holed themselves up, and plugged all entrances and exists to the West Wing, since there's smoke coming from that direction.

He is distrusting and slightly angry that the party has let a Frost Giant leave unharmed, though he later appreciates the help from the party in clearing out the manor from the attacking [[Black-Tears|Black Tears]]. 
### Likely party attitude:
\- Let a Frost Giant leave peacefully
\+ Cleared out the manor from bandits of the [[Black-Tears|Black Tears]]
\+ Extinguished fires in the manor
