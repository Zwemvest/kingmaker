# Marnius Charlorne
Marnius Cherlorne is the current Governor of [[Gralton-Realm|Gralton]] in the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]]. He was appointed in 4687 AR after the death of the previous governor, Hannon Gralt during a [[Bandits|bandit]] raid.

After the assault, Governor Cherlorne worked hard to restore order, quell the fears of the populace, and rebuild the fire-damaged [[Gralton-City|town]]. Despite his efforts, the settlement did not thrive after its repair. Even so, through his administration he did succeed in saving the town from total abandonment, and most of the citizens appreciate his efforts.
