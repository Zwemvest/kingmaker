# Oleg Leveton
Oleg is a trader originally from the city of [[Restov]]. Oleg left the city to pursue a life where he didn't have to deal with the noise and political intrigue of urban life, prefer to be the master of himself and his land. 

Oleg is a gruff and stubborn man. He is married to [[Svetlana-Leveton|Svetlana Leveton]], and together they run [[Olegs-Trading-Post|Oleg's Trading Post]], where they provide a modest trading service and a place for travellers to rest their weary bodies.

Oleg is a stocky middle-aged man, standing around 5'10. While physically fit, his age is catching up to him, leaving him better suited to doing work around the shop rather than going out and waving a sword at [[bandits]]. His hair grows to about shoulder length, and his beard is thick and bushy, often giving off a gruff impression.

Oleg is a loud man, to say the least. He values physical strength and honesty, and highly commends others who display it- almost as highly as he commends those with a good sense of humour or a big appetite. While reckless and likely to try put himself in dangerous situations he can't handle for the sake of others, Oleg is not unintelligent- in fact, his oafish demeanour hides a strikingly intelligent man.

## [[Session-1#28 Calistril 4710|28 Calistril 4710]]
After a three day travel to [[Olegs-Trading-Post|Oleg's Trading Post]], Oleg spotted the party arriving from [[Restov]] on the [[The-expedition-for-the-Stolen-Lands|Expedition for the Stolen Lands]]. His wife [[Svetlana-Leveton|Svetlana]] welcomed the travellers while Oleg kept working.

Oleg told the party he wasn't interested in what they were bringing to his trading post - he didn't want attention, gold or more travellers, he merely wanted to be kept alone. A new kingdom to the south would not be in his interests. 
## [[Session-1#1 Pharast 4710|1 Pharast 4710]]
The party saved [[Olegs-Trading-Post|Oleg's Trading Post]] from the [[Stag-Lord-Bandit-attack-on-Olegs-Trading-Post|Bandit attack on Oleg's Trading Post]]. 

### Likely party attitude:
\- Not interested in the interests of [[Brevoy]], the [[Aldori-Swordlords|Aldori Swordlords]], or those who work for them.
\+ Rescued [[Olegs-Trading-Post|Olegs Trading Post]] from a [[Stag-Lord-Bandits\|Stag Lord's Bandit]] attack.
