# Cesare Cattanei
Cesare Cattanei, also known as the Silver Fox, was a brigand and one of the founders of the River [[Pitax-Realm|Kingdom of Pitax]]. Originally from [[Brevoy]], Cattanei fled to [[Pitax-City|Pitax]] in 4312 AR, which was then just a sleepy village, to avoid the authorities. From there he and his compatriots would lead raids into [[Brevoy]] and other nearby communities. Once he had amassed enough wealth from his activities (and once the price on his head had grown substantially), Cattanei moved his operations wholly to the village of [[Pitax-City|Pitax]], building fortifications and hiring mercenaries to defend himself.
