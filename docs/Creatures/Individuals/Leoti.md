# Leoti
Leoti is the current [[Oakstewards#Voice|Voice of the Wind]] of the [[Oakstewards|Oakstewards]], and hence, their formal representation outside of [[Sevenarches-Realm|Sevenarches]], in particular at the [[Outlaw-Council|Outlaw Council]]. She is seen [[Sevenarches-City|in town]] about once a week. A middle-aged [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords|Kellid]] woman with a world-weary demeanor, Leoti is friendly, but no-nonsense in dealing with outsiders. She loves to hear stories of happenings in [[Numeria]].
