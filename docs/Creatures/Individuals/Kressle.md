# Kressle
Kessle is a lieutenant of the [[Stag-Lord-Bandits|Stag Lord's Bandits]] responsible for "collecting taxes" from [[Olegs-Trading-Post|Olegs Trading Post]]. She is described by [[Happs-Bydon|Happs Bydon]] as the rudest and meanest of the [[Stag-Lord-Bandits|Stag Lord's Bandits]] in all of the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]], and someone who is aggressive and vengeful - she'll surely take vengeance on the party for capturing [[Happs-Bydon|Happs Bydon]]

We sought out and captured Kressle on [[Session-3#2 Pharast 4710|2 Pharast 4710]]. With several other captured bandits, we brought her to [[Olegs-Trading-Post|Olegs Trading Post]], where she'll be picked up by guard convoys from [[Restov]] to do prison time for her banditry. 
### Likely party attitude:
\- Is a [[Bandits|bandit]], unwilling to work with pesky adventurers
\- Captured [[Happs-Bydon|Happs Bydon]]
\- Captured me and killed some of my bandits
