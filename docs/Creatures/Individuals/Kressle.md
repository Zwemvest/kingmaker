# Kressle
Kessle is a [[Bandits|bandit]] responsible for "collecting taxes" from [[Olegs-Trading-Post|Olegs Trading Post]]. She is described by [[Happs-Bydon|Happs Bydon]] as the rudest and meanest [[Bandits|bandit]] in all of the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]], and someone who is aggressive and vengeful - she'll surely take vengeance on the party for capturing [[Happs-Bydon|Happs Bydon]]

### Likely party attitude:
\- Is a bandit, unwilling to work with pesky adventurers
\- Captured [[Happs-Bydon|Happs Bydon]]
