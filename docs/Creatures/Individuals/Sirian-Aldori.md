# Sirian Aldori
Baron Sirian Aldori is the original founder of [[Rostland]] and the founder of the [[Aldori-Swordlords|Aldori Swordlords]]. [[Aldori-Swordlords|Aldori Swordlords]] still take on the "Aldori" name.

## History
Baron Sirian Aldori led [[Taldor|Taldan]] explorers to [[Rostland]] in the latter half of the Age of Enthronement, when he was known as Baron Sirian First. He is a hotheaded, impulsive noble forced to emigrate from [[Taldor]] after losing one too many duels. After the fledgling colony suffered a number of brutal attacks from [[Bandits|bandit]] lords to the south, First accepted a challenge from the ruling [[Bandits|bandit]] lord in 3035 AR to duel for the future of the burgeoning settlement. Unable to best the [[Bandits|bandit]] king, First paid his wager and disappeared, most assuming he was gone for good, too embarrassed to show his face after the defeat. In 3044 AR, First returned a changed man.

Answering to the name Sirian Aldori, the "Sword Baron" challenged the [[Bandits|bandit]] lord to a rematch and defeated him handily in seconds. He followed this with a standing offer of 100,000 gold pieces as a reward for any who could best him in a battle of blades. None could defeat him, whether through legitimate means or trickery and magic. At first, Aldori refused to teach any of his techniques, but he eventually capitulated and began to train a select group of swordsmen under certain stipulations. These conditions ensured that each student swore to change their name to Aldori, never teach their techniques to any outside the Aldori swordpact and were sworn to uphold a secret pact of honor.

These swordsmen became known as the [[Aldori-Swordlords|Aldori Swordlords]]. They ruled [[Rostland]] for generations, each as prickly and impulsive as the order's founder.
