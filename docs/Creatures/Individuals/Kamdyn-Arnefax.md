# Kamdyn Arnefax
Kamdyn Arnefax is an exiled knight from [[Andoran]]. He is a tall, muscular figure whose features suggest some [[Elf|elven]] blood. In 4674 AR he appeared in the realm of [[Lambreth]], in the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]]. 

At that time, [[Lambreth]] was threatened by imminent invasion from neighbouring [[Razmiran]]. In desperation, the ruling council of three merchant families (Cullertons, Angelidis, and Viscarra) offered the lordship of the realm to Kamdyn Arnefax if he could defeat the invaders.

Arnefax assembled an unlikely army of his household guards, [[Lambreth]] soldiers, refugees and infernal creatures, and launched a sneak attack on Razmiri forces. He won a great victory, which became known as the Moonlight Massacre of 26 Calistril, 4675 AR.

The Council had not expected him to survive the battle. When Tandre Cullerton suggested a delay in recognising Arnefax's lordship, the victorious general killed him and his wife, and exiled his family. 

Since then, he has ruled [[Lambreth]] without mercy or compassion, surviving numerous assassination attempts and wreaking bloody vengeance on those who oppose him.

Arnefax rules [[Lambreth]] from the former Cullerton Manor in [[Maashinelle]]. His only two friends are a pair of [[gnome]] siblings, Master Gardener Cenestin Maesner who is responsible for cultivating [[Lambreth]]'s river blackberries into the labyrinthine Thornward and Mistress of the Kennels Nevet Maesner who has tamed packs of shadow mastiffs and yeth hounds as guards and hunters. Arnefax's heavy armored horsemen, known as the feared Black Eagles, roam the realm usually at night, collecting the taxes, enforcing the law, and defending the people.

Arnefax makes frequent nocturnal visits to his borders riding a powerful nightmare. His people are terrified of his night riders and their shadowy dogs, but also proud that their ruler is powerful enough to keep the land free and safe.
