# Linzi
Linzi is a halfling bard, also on the [[The-expedition-for-the-Stolen-Lands|Expedition for the Stolen Lands]]. We got to know Linzi for her cheerful and optimistic demeanor, as well as her passion for storytelling and writing.

Linzi appears to have a history with the famous [[Academy-of-Grand-Arts|Academy of Grand Arts]]. She is from [[Pitax-Realm|Pitax]], but does not talk fondly about [[Pitax-Realm|Pitax]].

The party has gotten to know Linzi through conversations during their adventures at [[Jamandi-Aldori|Lady Jamandi]]'s banquet at [[Aldori-Manor|Aldori Manor]]. Linzi engaged with [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]], [[Djames]], and [[Kairos]], exchanging stories and gifts. She shared her musical talents and instruments with [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]], who showed curiosity about her petite stature. She spoke with [[Kairos]] about [[Pitax-Realm|Pitax]] politics, and [[Castruccio-Irovetti|King Irovetti]]. Linzi bonded with [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] over their shared love for storytelling and gifted [[Djames]] with Jade Cat and Onyx Panther figurines.

Linzi would later be captured by a [[Giants#Frost Giants|Frost Giant]], but Linzi managed to blind him. However, Linzi was cornered until the party managed to kill the [[Giants#Frost Giants|Frost Giant]] and free her. As a "thank you", she gifted [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] with a Scroll of Inkshot.
