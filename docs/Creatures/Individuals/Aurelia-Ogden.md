# Aurelia Ogden
Lady Ogden is the mayor of unstuck [[Uringen-City|Uringen]]. She and her advisor, Titor Restivo, actively attempt new experiments to rectify the settlement’s unique condition. Lady Ogden leaves most of the mundane duties to Sheriff Lugaid Ibarra. [[Knavar-Mieren|Knavar Mieren]] oversees the remainder of the town and protects any nearby encampments as mayor of the static part of the settlement.

Both mayors meet once a year prior to the [[Outlaw-Council|Outlaw Council]] to determine who will represent the kingdom. This decision, although prefaced by debate and attempts at guile, more often than not falls to a game of chance such as dice or cards. As keepers of mysterious knowledge regarding the town’s condition, the two mayors do not need to leverage violent abuse or tyrannical control over their citizens. Most people reside within Uringen to take part in the potion and alchemical trade, f ind a tolerable place to start a new life, or hide from an existing one.
