# Morgan the White
Morgan the White was a pirate from [[Cheliax]] who dreamt of "retiring" to a small patch of land somewhere, bringing along a number of like-minded individuals, and extorting passing water-traffic.

The plan required a region without a powerful navy, and Morgan eventually realised that the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]] were an ideal location. He called upon all of his pirate allies and contacts to join him and established a Protectorate on the banks of the [[Sellen-River|Sellen River]]. Hundreds of other pirates came to join him, and his protection racket on the river became known as the [[Pirate-Pact|Pirate Pact]].

Morgan attended the [[Outlaw-Council|Outlaw Council]] and promised to abide by the [[River-Freedoms|River Freedoms]]. As a result, his new [[Protectorate-of-the-Black-Marquis|Protectorate]] became an accepted part of the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]].

Morgan styled himself the White Marquis, and his realm was known as the [[Protectorate-of-the-Black-Marquis|Protectorate of the White Marquis]]. He was killed in 4702 AR by one of his erstwhile allies, who took control of the Protectorate and dubbed himself the Crimson Marquis.

There have been a number of violent regime changes in the brief number of years since Morgan's death, but the current inheritor of Morgan's dream is [[Urdul-Bazzak|Urdal Bazzak]]. He has taken the title of [[Urdul-Bazzak|Black Marquis]], so the region is currently known as the [[Protectorate-of-the-Black-Marquis|Protectorate of the Black Marquis]].
