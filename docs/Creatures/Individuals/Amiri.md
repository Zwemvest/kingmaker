# Amiri
Amiri is a [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords|Kellid]] barbarian from the [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords|Realm of the Mammoth Lords]], a harsh and rugged region. Amiri is known for her fierce warrior spirit, her giant-sized sword, and her quest for glory in battle. She is a strong, independent, and somewhat brash individual who values strength and honor.

She has a lot of experience in slaying [[Giants#Frost Giants|Frost Giants]], a rite of passage among her tribe.  

## [[Session-0#24 Calistril 4710|24 Calistril 4710]]
We met her during the start of the [[The-expedition-for-the-Stolen-Lands|Expedition for the Stolen Lands]]. She took a liking to [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]], gifting her a dagger.

## [[Session-0#25 Calistril 4710|25 Calistril 4710]]
She was captured in battle with [[Harrim]] and [[Valerie]] by a [[Giants#Frost Giants|Frost Giant]]. [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] would later negotiate a parlay between the Frost Giant, and the party plus [[Harrim]], [[Valerie]], and Amiri. Amiri did not appreciate this, believing Frost [[Giants]] cannot be trusted, and came to regret giving her a dagger. 
### Likely party attitude:
\+ [[Djames]]: Enjoyed the tall tales during the [[Grand-Banquet-at-Aldori-Manor|Grand Banquet]]
\+ Rescued from a Frost Gaint
\-- [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]]: Let a Frost Giant go against all reasoning 
\- Did not stop [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] from letting a Frost Giant go
