# Razmir
Razmir is the ruler of [[Razmiran]] and a self-proclaimed living deity.

Razmir appeared in the Arch-Duchy of Melcat, in the western part of the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]] in 4661 AR, claiming he had gained divinity by passing the Test of the Starstone. While he actually has no divine abilities, his incredible arcane power was enough proof of his godhood to many people.

He declared himself to the people of Xer, whose local magistrate had him arrested inside his very first temple. Razmir offered the magistrate a place in his clergy, and when the magistrate refused, Razmir turned him into a fox, then took control over Xer.

His religion quickly spread throughout the kingdom, with only the capital, Aerduin, resisting. Razmir approached the city at the edge of the Vergan Forest on 17 Erastus and demanded fealty of Duke Melcat three times; three times he was refused. That night he summoned a terrible cloud of fire, and by morning the city and all of its inhabitants had been reduced to ash and ruin. Few resisted him after that and the nation of [[Razmiran]] was born.
