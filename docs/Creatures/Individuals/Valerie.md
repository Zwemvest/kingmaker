She displays a guarded demeanor, offering only vague sentiments about seeking a fresh start when questioned about her motivations for joining the expedition to the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]]. Despite her reserved nature, Valerie eagerly engages in political discourse, displaying a keen interest in such matters. 

She recognizes [[Leonardo|Leonardo Lebeda]] from their shared circles in [[Brevoy]]'s noble society, leading to a discussion about their backgrounds and connections. [[Leonardo|Leonardo]] also tries to flirt with her, but to no avail, as she seems to cautiously steer the conversation away from any flirting.

She was captured in battle with [[Harrim]] and [[Amiri]] by a [[Giants#Frost Giants|Frost Giant]]. [[Lizzy-the-Leshby|Lizzy]] would later negotiate a parlay between the Frost Giant, and the party plus [[Harrim]], [[Amiri]], and Valerie. did not appreciate this, believing Frost [[Giants]] cannot be trusted, but came to accept the reasoning of the party.
