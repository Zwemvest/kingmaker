# Stag Lord Bandits
The [[Stag-Lord|Stag Lord]]'s [[Bandits]] are a group of outlaws and raiders operating under the command of the [[Stag-Lord|Stag Lord]]. They are notorious for their lawless activities in the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]], causing significant trouble for anyone trying to bring order to the region. 

The [[Stag-Lord|Stag Lord]] has several loyal lieutenants within the [[Bandits|bandit]] ranks, lower ranked figures who help enforce the [[Stag-Lord|Stag Lord]]'s commands and manage various aspects of the group's operations. One notable lieutenant is [[Kressle]], who oversees some of the [[Bandits|bandit]] camps.

The [[bandits]] consist of various ruffians, ex-soldiers, and other misfits who have turned to a life of crime. Many [[bandits]] are drawn to the [[Stag-Lord|Stag Lord]]'s charisma, leadership, and the promise of wealth from their plundering, and most stay because they fear his organization and the [[Stag-Lord|Stag Lord]] himself in person.

The [[bandits]] engage in a wide range of criminal activities, including raiding caravans, extorting local settlements, and ambushing travellers. Their operations spread fear throughout the [[Stolen-Lands|Stolen Lands]], making them a significant threat to the establishment of law and order. 

The [[bandits]] are typically armed with a mix of weapons and gear suited for ambushes and quick raids. They often use bows, swords, and makeshift armor. Their tactics include ambushes, hit-and-run attacks, and using the terrain to their advantage. 

The [[bandits]] are generally unscrupulous and willing to use violence to achieve their goals. However, a lot of them have personal reasons for joining the [[Stag-Lord|Stag Lord]]'s ranks, and little loyalty to the [[Stag-Lord|Stag Lord]] remains after the [[Stag-Lord|Stag Lord]] started to hit the bottle. Since his decisions turned more irrational and he's become less and less able to properly lead the [[bandits]], most [[bandits]] now stay loyal mostly out of fear of the [[Stag-Lord|Stag Lord]] personally, or out of the organization itself. We suspect the entire organization may collapse on itself if we take away the loyal lieutenants and kill the [[Stag-Lord|Stag Lord]] himself. 

The main stronghold of the [[bandits]] is the [[Stag-Lord|Stag Lord]]'s Fort, a heavily fortified fort that serves as the central base for the [[Bandits|bandit]] operations. It is located near the [[Tuskwater|Tuskwater Lake]].
