# Firebrands
The Firebrands are a loose organization of daredevils, liberators, and fighters against injustice with a reputation for sowing chaos in the wake of performing ostentatious acts.

The Firebrands are unofficially divided into two factions: those who fight tyrants, help those in need, and work to rebuild after the revolution; and those who seek thrills and to bring attention to themselves. The former once tried to dissociate themselves from the latter, before realising that their work is made much easier when public attention is kept on the show-offs, and many Firebrands are part of both groups. 

Firebrands can be found all across the [[Inner-Sea|Inner Sea]] region, especially in large cities where there are plenty of people to provide attention or crowds in which to disappear. These cities also allow would-be Firebrands to join a Firebrand ship and set off in search of treasure.
