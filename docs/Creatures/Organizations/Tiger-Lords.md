# Tiger Lords
The Tiger Lord barbarians are a tribe of Kellids along Brevoy's borderlands who trace their lineage to an Age of Destiny-era band of conquerors that once swept from the [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords|Realm of the Mammoth Lords]] to southeastern Numeria behind the warlord Armag.

Even today, they are the [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords|Kellid]] tribe with the broadest range of travel, providing mercenaries to such places as the [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords|Realm of the Mammoth Lords]] in the west to Iobaria in the east. The Tiger Lords draw their inspiration from dire tigers and revere an immense smilodon named Speartooth as their totem.
