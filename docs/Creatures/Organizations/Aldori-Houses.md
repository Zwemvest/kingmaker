# Aldori Houses
When [[Choral-Rogarvia|Choral the Conqueror]]'s army invaded [[Rostland]], nine major Houses of [[Brevoy]] as well as twenty or so minor Houses, fled [[Rostland]]. These Houses migrated south into the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]], and they become known as the Houses in Exile. They easily conquered a region and founded the city-state of [[Mivon-Realm|Mivon]]. The Houses in Exile had no clear line of succession from the court among them as the most prominent [[Brevoy|Brevic]] Houses remained behind to battle. Thus, the exiles began their fight for supremacy soon after the establishment of their small kingdom.

Today, [[Mivon-Realm|Mivon]] is a meritocracy and governed by the [[Raston-Selline|Mayor]] of the [[Mivon-City|city of Mivon]]. Mayor [[Raston-Selline|Raston Selline]] claims that the city will pass to the hands of whomever can defeat him in a duel. The High Council is officially the advisory board of the Mayor and the [[Aldori-Swordlords|Aldori]] members of the Houses in Exile proffer legislation and speak for the nobility in the politics of the city. The Houses agree on little. Each [[Aldori-Swordlords|Aldori]] House fields its own militia, flies its own colors, and swears fealty to a master, rather than to Mivon as a whole. They compete with each other for the right to provide the necessary military duties. [[Raston-Selline|Selline]] plays a complicated game in rotating these duties among the Houses. The keeps of the nine great [[Aldori-Swordlords|Aldori]] Houses as well as a number of small villages and farms around them, create a wide ring around the [[Mivon-City|city of Mivon]].

The nine great Aldori Houses are: Besalle, Chequer, Decanto, Eastway, Hargid, Medranti, Nealford, Seloma, and Tolanor.
