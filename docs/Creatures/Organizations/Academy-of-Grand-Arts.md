# Academy of Grand Arts
Under [[Castruccio-Irovetti|Irovetti]]'s leadership, [[Pitax-Realm|Pitax]] established the Academy of Grand Arts and the Red Crescent Theater. Though they aspire to great art, the teachers and students at these institutions receive little in the way of funding or artistic freedom. [[Castruccio-Irovetti|Irovetti]] insists on carefully controlling whatever the various artists, musicians, actors, and other performers of the academy create or do. As a result, the talented sorts that [[Castruccio-Irovetti|Irovetti]] hoped to attract to the academy never come, instead leaving only those with limited talents and great delusions of grandeur to enter its gates. The most successful are usually those who feed [[Castruccio-Irovetti|Irovetti]]'s appetite for vulgar spectacle.
