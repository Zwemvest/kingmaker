# Forlorn
The Forlorn are a category of [[elf]] that differ from other [[Elf|elves]] by upbringing rather than ethnicity. They spend their lengthy childhood in non-[[Elf|elven]] (typically [[human]]) communities, and tend toward melancholy because of the extraordinary imbalance in life expectancy between them and their adopted families. The earliest Forlorn were the orphaned children of [[Elf|elves]] who refused to abandon Golarion from the predicted devastation wrought by Earthfall.
