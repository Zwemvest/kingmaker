# Eagle Knights
The Eagle Knights of Andoran are a state-funded military organization sworn to protect their homeland, and to destroy slavery and those who profit from it. Often working as moles inside slaving organizations, the Eagle Knights, while well intentioned, are as insidious as many of the more evil organizations in Golarion. 

## River Kingdoms
The people of the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]] generally regard them quite positively, since slavery is traditionally considered abhorrent there in accordance with the Fifth River freedom. Many foreigners who support the Eagle Knights' goal of ending slavery nevertheless feel some reservations about accepting their help, realizing that it is always accompanied by a push to shift societies toward greater equality and representation; equality that could threaten their own power.

## History
The Eagle Knights of Andoran are viewed by some as a shining example of the best of
humanity in the face of a dark and cruel world populated by tyrants and filled with injustice. Others view them as benevolent but misguided ideological imperialists. Based within the nation of Andoran, the Eagle Knights find inspiration in its creed of common rule by the people, free mercantilism, and the respect of individual liberty. In many ways, they are best characterized as a military order devoted to the preservation and spread of Andoran’s philosophical tenets.

The common impression of an Eagle Knight is of a soldier or paladin dressed in the blue-and-white regalia of the order and clad with the hallmark golden epaulets. Even the least foot soldier within the Eagle Knights’ ranks stands among the best of the [[Andoran|Andoren]] military, from which most of their number are initially recruited. Not all Eagle Knights are so open in their self-identification, however, nor are they all recruited from the upper tiers of the [[Andoran|Andoren]] military, or even from the [[Andoran|Andoren]] people.
