# Black Tears
Originally formed through a merger of seven street gangs from New Stetven and Port Ice, the Black Tears are a criminal organization of cutthroats and thieves known to dabble in kidnapping, extortion, assassination, and the sale of illicit substances. Members are fanatically loyal and exceptionally ruthless. Each carries the group’s signature weapon (a dagger with an ebony pommel), displays a trail of three black tears tattooed under their left eye, and bears a tattooed script on their right forearm that reads “Live free or slaughter” in Draconic. 

They attack [[Aldori-Manor|Aldori Manor]] on [[Session-0#25 Calistril 4710|25 Calistril 4710]], but the attack ended with the death of their luitenant [[Volodmyra]]. Though they slaughtered many adventurers present at the [[Grand-Banquet-at-Aldori-Manor|Grand Banquet]] for the [[The-expedition-for-the-Stolen-Lands|Expedition for the Stolen Lands]], the party luckily survived. They also tried to set fire to [[Aldori-Manor|Aldori Manor]] and kill [[Jamandi-Aldori|Lady Jamandi Aldori]], but did not succeed in killing her, and the damage was repaired by the next morning.
