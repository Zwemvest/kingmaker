# Brevoy nobility
The nation of [[Brevoy|Brevoy]] has seven major noble families. The most historically important are House Rogarvia, descendants of [[Choral-Rogarvia|Choral the Conqueror]], and House Surtova, descended from the old [[Issia|Issian]] pirate kings and family of the current ruler of [[Brevoy]]: [[Noleski-Surtova|King Noleski Surtova]]. 

## Noble families
The seven major [[Brevoy|Brevoy]] noble families are listed below.
## Rogarvia
The former ruling house of [[Brevoy]], House Rogarvia—informally, the Rogarvians —was founded by the descendants of [[Choral-Rogarvia|Choral the Conqueror]] and Myrna Rogarvia, daughter of Nikos Surtova. [[Choral-Rogarvia|Choral]] united [[Rostland]] and [[Issia]] into the kingdom of [[Brevoy|Brevoy]] after invading from [[Iobaria]], accompanied by dragons.

Most members of the House, including King Urzen Rogarvia, disappeared mysteriously in 4699 AR, in an event called the "Vanishing". Their loss is not greatly mourned by the [[Brevoy|Brevic]] people and loyalists are calling for an investigation instead of blind allegiance to [[Noleski-Surtova|Noleski Surtova]], who declared himself king.

The Rogarvia family motto is "With Sword and Flame" 
## Garess
House Garess is based in the western part of [[Brevoy]], in the foothills of the Golushkin Mountains. It is led by Lord Howlan Garess, who is a widower. His adoptive heir is Toval Golka, a [[dwarf]] and son of the clan-chief of the Golka [[Dwarf|dwarves]]' holding. Howlan's own son disappeared in the Vanishing along with all the Golka [[Dwarf|dwarves]], deep inside [[Dwarf|dwarven]] hold of Golushkin within the Golushkin Mountains.

House Garess had a good relationship with the Golka [[Dwarf|dwarves]] until the [[Dwarf|dwarves]] vanished. Members of the house worked the metal that the [[Dwarf|dwarves]] mined.

The Garess family motto is "Strong as the Mountains" 
## Lebeda
House Lebeda is a noble family of the [[Avistan|Avistani]] nation of [[Brevoy]]. Its central holdings are located southwest of Lake Reykal in [[Rostland]], controlling the plains and significant portions of the lake's shipping. They are considered to be the [[Brevoy|Brevic]] noble family that epitomizes [[Rostland]], having significant [[Taldor|Taldan]] blood, an appreciation for fine things, and a love of sword fighting.

The Labeda family motto is "Success Through Grace" 

[[Lander-Lebeda|Lander Lebeda]] is the current house head. His son, [[Leonardo|Leonardo Lebeda]], is the current heir.
## Lodovka
House Lodovka is a noble family of [[Brevoy|Brevoy]] with their headquarters on Acuben Isle on the [[Lake-of-Mists-and-Veils|Lake of Mists and Veils]]. They have traditionally been a power on the lake. Led by Lord Kozek Lodovka, both their fleet size and influence along the lake continue to increase. The fleet primarily catches fish and freshwater crabs

The Lodovka family motto is "The Waters, Our Fields" 

## Medvyed
House Medvyed is a noble house of [[Brevoy|Brevoy]] that holds authority over the eastern lands that border and contain the Icerime Peaks and Gronzi Forest. They have maintained the traditions of worshiping nature, the "Old Way". Lord Gurev Medyed heads the Stoneclimb-based house. 

The people of the area raise mountain goats and sheep. They hunt in the forest and farm what little good land is on the edges of their concerns. Religion in this area tends to be more centralized on [[Erastil|Erastil]], but rumors of hidden shrines to [[Lamashtu]] do exist.

The Medvyed family motto is "Endurance Overcomes All" 

## Orlovsky
House Orlovsky controls northeastern [[Brevoy|Brevoy]] from Eagle's Watch on Mount Veshka. They try to rise above petty political maneuvers. As staunch allies of the now disappeared House Rogarvia, this has landed them in a prickly situation. If Lord Poul Orlovsky chooses to rebel against [[Noleski-Surtova|Noleski Surtova]], they could potentially align with House Garess and House Medvyed. These three houses could disrupt supply and travel routes between House Surtova's two power bases, Port Ice and New Stetven.

The Orlovsky family motto is "High Above" 
## Surtova
House Surtova is the current ruling family of [[Brevoy]], and the oldest and most influential [[Brevoy|Brevic]] noble family.

Their original holdings are the environs of Port Ice in northern [[Issia]] on the shores of the [[Lake-of-Mists-and-Veils|Lake of Mists and Veils]]. Their claim to the throne is linked to Nikos Surtova giving the hand of his daughter, Myrna Surtova, to [[Choral-Rogarvia|Choral the Conqueror]] in marriage. This marriage allowed the house to keep its power as a staunch ally of House Rogarvia. In 4699 AR, during the Vanishing, House Surtova was able to use its high position to immediately claim regency until the Rogarvia's returned.

The Surtovans are known as careful and cunning diplomats. Before [[Choral-Rogarvia|Choral the Conqueror]] invaded, the Surtovans were pirates and raiders, and the family still has many connections with the pirates and brigands of the region, many of whom are distant relations of the Surtova clan. One of the more active pirates of the [[Lake-of-Mists-and-Veils|Lake of Mists and Veils]], Captain Vali Dobos, is rumoured to have a close connection with the Surtovas, although he keeps his lineage hidden.

The Surtova family motto is "Ours Is the Right"
