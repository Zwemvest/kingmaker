# Touvette Charities
The General established his charities so the people could thrive. The citizens of [[Touvette]] are the most educated in the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]]: 8 out of 10 adults can read and write. If a farmer falls ill, workers from the charity treat him until he is better, and work his crops so the village has food for the season. If a blacksmith loses a hand, the charity takes him in, finding work for him so his family does not starve. Any and all citizens are free to enter the charity building. Here they learn how to read, write, and count. The charities also organize workers to repair damaged buildings, teach farmers how to plant new crops, and build homes for the homeless. If a storm strikes or monsters invade, the people head to the safety and sanctuary of the charity.

If a legal grievance arises, the people go to the charity where a judge—appointed by the General—sits in judgment on the case. Portraits of the General (and his great deeds) decorate every charity. The charities train [[Touvette]]’s soldiers, and all men of adult age are ready to protect the people from external dangers— including adventurers with foreign ideas about liberty and justice. Their loyalty to their kingdom is strong, and to the General it is even stronger.
