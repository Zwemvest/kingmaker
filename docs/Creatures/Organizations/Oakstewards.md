# Oakstewards
The Oakstewards are the true rulers of [[Sevenarches-Realm|Sevenarches]] and lead with a hand that is alternately detached and heavy. The druids seem unmoved by cries of [[human]] injustice, but act quickly to defend land and citizens against despoilers, springing from within the trees themselves to prevent harm to their demesne. The Oakstewards operate in infuriating secrecy, keeping silent even when communication would help their causes. No one knows exactly how many Oakstewards exist. 

There are more than four Oakstewards, and probably more positions that the druids hold internally, though the druids share no further information on this topic. The revolving nature of the Oakstewardsâ€™ governance makes it difficult for outsiders to build relationships. A different Voice of the Wind attends every [[Outlaw-Council|Outlaw Council]]. Policy remains consistent, but the different druids have displayed wildly varying diplomatic abilities. The Oakstewards meet and confer in a secret lodge in the [[Elderwoods]]. The lodge exists within a series of enormous, ancient oak trees, joined via branches and other growths to create one great internal room.

In accordance with thousands of years of tradition, the Oakstewards treat adventurers in one of two ways. Anyone asked to serve, or who formally requests Oaksteward permission to accomplish a specific task within [[Sevenarches-Realm|Sevenarches]] (the explanation must be short, clear, and of obvious benefit to the Oakstewards) may be given a barkwrit, a heavy, rectangular slab of oak bark carved with a druidic rune, as a token indicating safe passage. Anyone bearing a barkwrit receives free food and lodging in civilized [[Sevenarches-City|Sevenarches]], and respect (though not guaranteed safety) in wilder parts of the kingdom. Alternatively, adventurers are as free to wander the kingdom as any other wild creature. In this case, the Oakstewards offer no protection, and may appear at scenes of peril to act as witnesses, not saviors. Foreigners who do significant harm to the land or its occupants may well face the Sharp of the Bark in high dudgeon. Of course, if an outsider is [[Elf|elven]], the Oakstewards summarily act to expel the trespasser.
## Voices
Four roles among the druids communicate with the outside world, chosen each year during the winter solstice. 
* The Voice of the Wind serves as the speaker to outsiders, and the foreign affairs diplomat. 
* The Root of the Sapling encourages growth of crops and children. 
* The Bloom of the Harvest ensures proper food distribution to [[Sevenarches-Realm|Sevenarches]] residents and foreign buyers. 
* The Sharp of the Bark defends the borders, waters, and roads of [[Sevenarches-Realm|Sevenarches]].
