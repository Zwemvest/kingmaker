# Bandits
Far more bandits roam the Kingdoms than one would think the population could absorb. Criminals and castoffs from nearby nations, as well as natives, frequently take a turn at banditry here. The law is flexible, and the [[River-Freedoms|Sixth River Freedom]] subtly encourages it.

Despite the fierce reputation of [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]] bandits, many young men and women only try banditry as a side job, or as a found opportunity when they happen upon treasure left in weak hands. For a few, it’s the only way to retrieve what was stolen from them first. Other bandits are mercenary soldiers turned out of their previous jobs. They would rather fight than steal, but they’d rather live than starve.

Commoners are a hardscrabble lot, so for profit, bandits target wealthy outsiders. Most cities contain lookouts for bandit crews, gathering information on likely visiting targets, or offering guide services to lure visitors into traps. The locals are always wise to these tricks, and for a handful of coppers, a local can usually identify the lookouts... assuming he isn’t one of them himself.

For a charismatic few, banditry is a path to legitimacy. Bandit gangs past a certain size gain their own gravity; highway robbery becomes usurpation at a surprisingly low threshold in the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]]. More than once, a bandit leader has ended up taking over a keep that he only meant to plunder at the outset.

Yet the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]] are far from lawless; it’s just that the laws they adhere to appear lawless in practice. The Six [[River-Freedoms|River Freedoms]] receive a lot of lip service, but the primary law of the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]] is that power rules. The members of the [[Outlaw-Council|Outlaw Council]] would be quick to inform would-be philosophers that all nations follow this rule; the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]] just aren’t shy about admitting it.
