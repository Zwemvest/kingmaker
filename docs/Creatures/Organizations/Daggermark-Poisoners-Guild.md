# Daggermark Poisoners' Guild
The Daggermark Poisoners' Guild was established in the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdom]] of [[Daggermark-Realm|Daggermark]] 90 years ago by a poisoner from [[Cheliax]] named Ambras Imre. Many blame the Guild for the death of the last king of [[Daggermark-Realm|Daggermark]], who choked to death at dinner within a few months of Imre's arrival in the city. The Guild's current leader is Tragshi the Herbalist. It has close links with the [[Daggermark-Assassins-Guild|Daggermark Assassins' Guild]], and its reputation has spread across [[Avistan]] and even beyond.
