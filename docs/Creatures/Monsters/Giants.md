# Giants
Giants are massive humanoid creatures who live in remote regions throughout the world. All giants share one common trait: massive humanoid forms. They often range from 12 to 40 feet tall and measure their weight in tons. They are divided into a number of subtypes, but the most broad classification are true giants and giantkin.

Though potentially able to speak many languages, giants also have a common language known simply as Giant or Jotun. The language of the giants that exists today is a mixture of Cyclops and Thassilonian. First used by the giant slaves of the runelords in the time before Earthfall, it spread to the rest of [[Golarion]] after the destruction of that realm.
## Frost Giants
Frost giants are remorseless marauders who pillage and plunder from those who dare to live near them in desolate, frigid lands. Their clans range from extremely territorial hunters who claim an expanse of tundra and defend it at all costs to nomadic hordes that roam icy slopes in search of settlements to conquer. Frost giant clans are ruled by those who exhibit the greatest ferocity and prowess in battle—massive brutes who proclaim themselves jarl and demand absolute obedience from their followers. If at any time a frost giant wishes to be a jarl, all they must do is issue a challenge to the current jarl and face off in mortal combat, after which the reigning champion continues leading the clan or the victorious challenger assumes control.

Frost giants live in frostbitten realms, and their appearance is reflective of a people weathered and hardened by relentless snowstorms and freezing temperatures. They often wear metal armor adorned with the furs, skin, teeth, and tusks of slain beasts and heft weapons as long as dining tables. Their flesh ranges from pale blue to shale gray, and their hair is typically a dingy white or dirty yellow color. As they are impervious to cold, they tend to frequent [[Avistan]]'s northern latitudes. They are particularly common in the witch realm of Irrisen and near the Crown of the World.

A typical frost giant stands about 15 feet tall and weighs approximately 2,800 pounds.

Frost giants are among the most feared of the giants, as they are highly aggressive, prone to blood-lust, and very fond of raiding. They prefer attacking from surprise, and are quite adept at blending into their snowy environment. They prefer launching small boulders at their targets until they run out of ammunition, then switch to their massive greataxes.

These giants live almost entirely by raiding and hunting. Roughly half of their population lives in small nomadic bands or tribes, while the rest settle down in abandoned castles or caves. They are known to often ally with fearsome winter wolves and, though they tend to dominate such alliances, frost giants must be careful not to antagonise their lupine allies as they have been known to tear giants that upset them limb from limb.

Frost Giants often have a weakness to fire. Some [[Realm-of-the-Mammoth-Lords|Kellid]], like [[Amiri]], hunt Frost Giants.
