# Brush Thylacines
The thylacine is a marsupial predator known for its distinctive striped lower back. These ferociously territorial thylacines are known as a dangerous beast that adventurers might come across in the wilderness. They often attack creatures without provocation, and they are prone to leaving barely eaten carcasses strewn about their territories as additional markers of their dominance.

This nocturnal predator typically hunts alone, only occasionally forming small packs. Because of their odd appearance, thylacines have a far harsher reputation than they probably should, playing a sort of bogeyman role in farming communities. In the Inner Sea region, thylacines are rare outside the Stolen Lands. However, much larger breeds of thylacines—some the size of horses or even larger—dwell in southern Arcadia and on the plains of central Casmaron.
