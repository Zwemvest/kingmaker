# Fey
Fey are soul-bearing supernatural creatures originating from soul energy in the [[First-World|First World]]. While effectively immortal in the [[First-World|First World]], they still have mortal souls, if of a different nature than those of the Material Plane. They cannot die without extremely powerful magic, and simply reform from the matter of the [[First-World|First World]] after some variable amount of time. From dryads and satyrs to gremlins and nuckelavees, fey are varied beyond imagination.

## Fey bargains
Fey sometimes make magical agreements, fey bargains, in which they imbue the trade partner with limited supernatural power in exchange for something that is always unusual and personal, such as the first syllable of the person's name, or the ability to see the moon. Breaking such a bargain brings a significant curse upon the oath-breaker, and attempting to end the bargain prematurely always heightens its cost. Bestowed magical powers always are of the primal tradition, and the more powerful a fey, the more potent its boon
