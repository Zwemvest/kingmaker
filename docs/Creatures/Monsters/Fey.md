# Fey
Fey are soul-bearing supernatural creatures originating from soul energy in the [[First-World|First World]]. While effectively immortal in the [[First-World|First World]], they still have mortal souls, if of a different nature than those of the Material Plane. They cannot die without extremely powerful magic, and simply reform from the matter of the [[First-World|First World]] after some variable amount of time. From dryads and satyrs to gremlins and nuckelavees, fey are varied beyond imagination.

Breaking such a bargain brings a significant curse upon the oath-breaker, and attempting to end the bargain prematurely always heightens its cost. Bestowed magical powers always are of the primal tradition, and the more powerful a fey, the more potent its boon
