# Calistria
As symbolized by the three daggers of her religious symbol, [[Calistria|Calistria]] has three aspects: lust, revenge, and trickery. Silver-tongued and charming, she is a master of weaving insults into compliments and laying intricate groundwork for retribution at its finest. She is a goddess of vengeance, but it would be a mistake to assume that means she pursues justice. [[Calistria|Calistria]] is fickle, shifting her loyalties and interests as her whims take her—though she never forgets a slight, and any who think she has forgiven will surely find it is only a matter of time before they are targeted by a long-term plot of revenge to lay them thoroughly low.

## Edicts  
pursue your personal freedom, seek hedonistic thrills, take revenge
## Anathema  
become too consumed by love or a need for revenge, let a slight go unanswered
