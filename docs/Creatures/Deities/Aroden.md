# Aroden
Aroden (pronounced AIR-oh-den) was the immortal Azlanti [[human]] who raised the Starstone from the bottom of the [[Inner-Sea|Inner Sea]] in 1 AR, founded the city of Absalom, and became the patron deity of humanity. He was once prophesied to lead humanity into an Age of Glory, but on the day of his supposed return, he apparently died of mysterious causes, catapulting [[Golarion]] into an uncertain future and the Age of Lost Omens.
