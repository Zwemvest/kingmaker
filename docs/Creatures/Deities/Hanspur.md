# Hanspur
Hanspur is a demigod of the waterways worshiped primarily in the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]]. Hanspur is the god of the watery domains of the [[Sellen-River|Sellen River]] and considers himself lord of all who travel his domain. As a travel god, his shrines always lie just outside the town gates. Despite this, he is still paid at least lip service by the peoples of the [[River-Kingdoms|River Kingdoms]], as he smites those who displease him by sinking their boats and flooding their lands.

It’s said Hanspur plies the [[Sellen-River|Sellen River]] in the guise of a grizzled riverman accompanied by his pet dire rat. He’s usually dour and taciturn, though he’s said to sometimes have friendly conversations with those who respect the river. His doctrine comprises the [[River-Freedoms|Six River Freedoms]] and includes only a few other simple statements about the changing nature of things, how life is a river, and death on the water is a good end to a simple life. He dislikes dams and anyone who would block or change the course of rivers.
