# Hanspur
It’s said Hanspur plies the Sellen River in the guise of a grizzled riverman accompanied by his pet dire rat. He’s usually dour and taciturn, though he’s said to sometimes have friendly conversations with those who respect the river. His doctrine comprises the Six River Freedoms and includes only a few other simple statements about the changing nature of things, how life is a river, and death on the water is a good end to a simple life. He dislikes dams and anyone who would block or change the course of rivers.
