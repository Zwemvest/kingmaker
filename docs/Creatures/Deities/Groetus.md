# Groetus
Ancient beyond mortal reckoning, Groetus is an entity who cannot be easily understood. He hangs in the sky above the Boneyard, a skull-faced moon constantly observing the passage of the souls below. Events can cause him to draw ominously closer to [[Pharasma]]’s Spire, or to retreat back to a safer distance, with little obvious rhyme or reason for these actions. He evinces little regard for anything but his singular aim: the dissolution of the universe.

## Edicts 
Preach of the upcoming end times, destroy that which has outlived its usefulness, put the suffering out of their misery
## Anathema 
Artificially extend something’s existence or lifespan, spread hope

[[Harrim]] is a worshipper of Groetus.
