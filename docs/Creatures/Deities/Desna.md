# Desna
The night didn’t know beauty until [[Desna|Desna]] came into existence. While the other gods toiled away to create the world, she set her sights on the heavens, placing each star in the sky. After surveying her artistry, she hung the brightest star high in the north and made it her home. Her first gift to mortals was this beacon of hope, a twinkling sign in the dark sky that they could turn to when lost or unsure of themselves. [[Desna|Desna]] provides safe passage through the darkness to all, should they choose to follow.
