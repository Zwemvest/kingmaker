# Gorum
The clash of steel, the cry of victory, the gasping denial of death: these are the sound of prayers to Our Lord in Iron, for to follow [[Gorum|Gorum]] is to fight. [[Gorum|Gorum]] does not care the reason for battle—a village’s desperate stand against raiders is no less worthwhile to him than a crusader army marching against demons in the [[Sarkoris-Scar|Sarkoris Scar]]—nor does he choose sides in such clashes. Good or evil, law or chaos, the reason for the fight is irrelevant. It is the thrill of battle that finds his favor, the crucible of struggle in which victory is there for the taking.

## Edicts  
attain victory in fair combat, push your limits, wear armor in combat
## Anathema
