The minor goddess Milani (pronounced meh-LAW-nee), also known as the [[Everbloom]], is the patron of all those who fight against oppression and unjust rule. Her symbol is a rose growing out of a blood-soaked street.

Until the death of [[Aroden]] in 4606 AR, the goddess Milani was simply one of dozens of saints within the Last Azlanti's faith. She was the beacon of hope to all those who fought against repressive regimes, giving courage to those who had little but their desire to live a free life. The death of her patron, combined with the tremendous upheaval and suffering that followed his death, gave her a focus and attracted many new followers. Those devoted to her found the courage to organize the rebellions against the infernal takeover of the [[Cheliax|Chelish]] Empire, helping many of her outlying territories break free of its control. They fought against the slow slide into barbarism, restoring people's hope that a just and good society could be restored. Milani has never been as popular as [[Aroden]]'s other followers, such as [[Iomedae]], perhaps because the Inheritor's worship had already been firmly established before their patron's passing.

The party encountered a statue to Milani on [[Session-1#25 Calistril 4710|25 Calistril 4710]], and may have received a small boon from her during the [[Attack-on-Lady-Jamandi-Aldoris-Manor|Attack on Lady Jamandi Aldori's Manor]]
