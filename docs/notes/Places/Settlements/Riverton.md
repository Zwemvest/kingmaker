# Riverton
Worship of Hanspur is at the heart of life in Riverton. Anyone joining the community is expected to
undergo the water-born rite: a baptism where dedicants are held underwater until “the spirit of Hanspur” touches them and they fall unconscious, at which point the River Preacher lifts them up and forces them to cough out the water they’ve inhaled. Religious services are held daily at dusk, and all community members are expected to attend. Naerel Twice-Born leads the worshipers in a walk out from the shore into the waters of the lake, where the spirit of the god sometimes seizes the River Preacher, causing him to thrash in the shallows as he cries out the contents of his visions. These have often provided insight or protected the settlement and the shrine from danger, but have also condemned intruders, blasphemers, and unbelievers to death in the depths.

Riverton survives on fishing and on the money brought in by pilgrims to the shrine, mostly seeking the advice or miracles of the River Preacher. The water-born—the faithful of the community—are also known for their skill as guides and pilots along the often treacherous waters of the River Kingdoms. Visitors sometimes hire a raft or boat to ferry them upriver or across the lake, and the right price ensures no questions are asked. Riverton welcomes travelers, provided they are willing to hear the words of Hanspur, looking to pay for guidance through the River Kingdoms, or both. Otherwise, strangers are encouraged not to linger.
