# Outsea
Outsea is a town in the River Kingdoms containing farmland, swampland, rivers, and canals. Its citizens include both aquatic species as well as air-breathers. Military service is mandated for all water-breathers and a few landlubbers serve in respected voluntary battalions. Locks and gates separate freshwater and salt water, preventing the districts from flowing into each other. Beneath the waterline, coral reefs and seaweed form underwater structures. Fish, octopuses, and other aquatic animals are prevalent. Mages of Outsea are known for their strong tradition of practicing water magic. Unique spells of merfolk and sahuagin origins can be found only in this kingdom.
