# Gyronna
Gyronna is a goddess of society’s female castoffs and undesirables: adulterous wives, suspected witches, aging prostitutes, and others whom society tosses away. Though she’s all but unheard of outside the River Kingdoms, the Riverfolk walk carefully around her clergy, fearing their ability to poison minds with resentment and hate, turnfriends against one another, and make enemies out of allies.

**Edicts**

**Anathema** 
Allow others to slight you without retaliation, seek the approval of society, forgive those who have wronged you
