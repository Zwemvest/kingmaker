# Eagle Knights
The Eagle Knights of Andoran are a state-funded military organization sworn to protect their homeland, and to destroy slavery and those who profit from it. Often working as moles inside slaving organizations, the Eagle Knights, while well intentioned, are as insidious as many of the more evil organizations in Golarion. 

The people of the River Kingdoms generally regard them quite positively, since slavery is traditionally considered abhorrent there in accordance with the Fifth River freedom. Many foreigners who support the Eagle Knights' goal of ending slavery nevertheless feel some reservations about accepting their help, realizing that it is always accompanied by a push to shift societies toward greater equality and representation; equality that could threaten their own power.
