Some seek to unlock the secret history of the world, piecing together the past one fragment at a time. Others are in it for the money, filtering priceless antiquities through a series of unscrupulous merchants to enrich themselves beyond measure. Still other Pathfinders take up the trade because they find the thrill of risking their lives more addicting and exhilarating than any vice or drug.</p> <p>A shadowy inner circle of masked leaders known as the Decemvirate rules the Pathfinder Society from the bustling metropolis of Absalom, the so-called City at the Center of the World. There, in a huge fortress complex called the Grand Lodge, the Ten manage a vast organization of agents spread throughout the Inner Sea region and beyond. These officers, known as venture-captains, coordinate teams of Pathfinders in their assigned regions, tipping them off to ancient legends, passing along newly discovered maps, and supporting their efforts in the field. Venture-captains are an ideal \u201cin-world\u201d source of adventure leads, making them indispensable NPCs in your Pathfinder campaign. That doesn\u2019t necessarily make every venture-captain an unswerving ally, however. The ultimate goals of the Decemvirate are inscrutable, and not even the venture- captains understand the full picture of what the Pathfinder Society does with all of the information it collects. Each venture-captain oversees the activities of several tightly knit groups of Pathfinder field agents, who conduct much of the exploration and adventures that fuel the society as a whole. Perhaps your player characters are one such group, moving from locale to locale to discover the lost secrets of dead civilizations and the wondrous treasures they left behind.</p> <p>Pathfinder agents provide detailed written reports of their exploits to their venture-captains, who then forward the most compelling records to the Grand Lodge in Absalom for consideration by the Decemvirate. Periodically, the masked leaders of the society collect and publish the greatest exploits in new volumes of the Pathfinder Chronicles, which they send back to their venture-captains for distribution to field agents. Whenever a new volume of the Pathfinder Chronicles hits the field, dozens of adventurers flock to the sites described therein for further exploration and adventure. Although they belong to the same society, individual groups of Pathfinder agents often find themselves at cross- purposes in the field, particularly if each team reports to a different venture-captain.

As the group grew and became more formalized, a governing council of 10 members was formed\u2014the original Decemvirate. With the organization\u2019s continued expansion in both popularity and wealth, the members of the Decemvirate were eventually masked for their own safety, and today the Pathfinder Society is ruled by a shadowy group of masked individuals whose identities are unknown and unheralded. Presumably, the composition of the Decemvirate has changed over the passing of centuries, but when or how the Ten recruit new members is as secretive as their true identities.</p> <p>Operatives known as venture-captains coordinate teams of Pathfinder agents in their assigned regions, tipping them off to ancient legends, passing along newly discovered maps, and supporting efforts in the field. Each venture-captain oversees the activities of several different Pathfinder field agents, who in turn conduct much of the exploration and adventure that fuels the Society as a whole. Venture-captains are fairly autonomous but still answer to the Decemvirate. The ultimate goals of the Decemvirate are inscrutable, and not even the venture-captains understand the full picture of what the Pathfinder Society does with the information it collects.</p> <p>The Society\u2019s chief resource is its vast organization of operatives spread throughout the Inner Sea region and beyond. Venture-captains in cities or especially remote locations usually run lodges where they conduct Pathfinder business. Typically a house or building owned by the Society, a Pathfinder lodge is completely under the administration of the local venture-captain. Agents may stay in a lodge as long as they are on legitimate Pathfinder business, but to deter freeloaders, lodges rarely offer food or extensive free services. Most venture-captains keep small stores of potions, scrolls, and mundane adventuring equipment for sale to agents. Mercenary venture-captains charge exorbitant prices for these if they believe their agents have uncovered a treasure haul. As information conduits, venture-captains also pass along letters or messages through Pathfinder channels upon agent request.</p> <p>The original and greatest Pathfinder lodge is located in Absalom\u2014this structure is known as the Grand Lodge, a massive fortress complex located in the city\u2019s Foreign Quarter. The Grand Lodge is a place of wonder and education, a bastion of knowledge designed to inspire and organize all those who live for discovery. During the day its carefully manicured lawns and monument-strewn plazas are dotted with Pathfinders trading information, and at night the sounds of stories and songs resound along stone pathways lit gently by witchlights.</p> <p>The most recognizable name among the Pathfinders is legendary Durvin Gest, author of many of the best- known tales from the first several Pathfinder Chronicles. Yet the very nature of the Pathf inder Society ensures that the organization attracts a host of oddball characters and impassioned adventurers determined to make their mark on the face of Golarion. Many of these have become legends in their own right. Currently, a man named Ambrus Valsin serves as the steward for the Grand Lodge. He supervises all important duties within the structure and keeps a long list of relatively safe but time-consuming jobs on file to keep rookie Pathf inders busy. Three other venture-captains\u2014broad-shouldered Marcos Farabellus, radical arcane theorist Aram Zey, and eccentric Kreighton Shaine\u2014serve at the Grand Lodge as the masters of swords, spells, and scrolls, respectively. The Grand Lodge\u2019s newest venture-captain to rise to prominence is Shevala Iorae, a Varisian woman who got her start adventuring among the crumbling ruins of ancient Thassilon. Other venture-captains, like Galtan expatriate Eliza Petulengro, strangely deep-voiced Sheila Heidmarch of Magnimar, Darklands expert and scandal- prone Koriah Azmeren, and the enigmatic Chelaxian known only as Osprey, work constantly to ensure that the needs of the Pathfinder Society are well represented throughout the Inner Sea region.</p>","tags":["Organization"]},{"location":"Creatures/Organizations/Pathfinder-Society/#goals","title":"Goals","text":"<p>The Pathfinder Society makes few demands on agents.

The freedom for agents to be, do, and say anything they want is likely the organization\u2019s most consistently distinct aspect.

Types include</p> <ul> <li>Anarchy: The complete absence of organized government. This state exists intermittently throughout the River Kingdoms, but sustaining it as a form of actual policy is exceptionally difficult. Formal government: Daggermark</li> <li>Aristocracy: Rule by a hereditary class of people. Usually subsumed under a monarchy. Formal government: Artume, Gralton</li> <li>Autocracy: Government in which one person has sole, unrestricted rule. Also known as despotism. The majority of River Kingdoms are ruled by autocrats. Bureaucracy: Rule through a system of departments or bureaus, arranged in a hierarchy of authority. Department heads and staff are usually appointed rather than elected or openly decided. Formal government: Pitax</li> <li>Confederacy: Rule under a union of states, organizations, or individuals. Formal government: Lambreth</li> <li>Democracy: Majority rule by the people. Rulers are elected from among the populace. Formal government: Uringen, Outsea</li> <li>Dictatorship:  Although a form of autocracy, a dictator has no plans or aspirations for hereditary rule. Formal government: Lambreth, Touvette, Tymon, Liberthane</li> <li>Ethnocracy:  Government in which rulership is limited to those of a particular ethnicity or race.</li> <li>Feudality:  A loosely defined form of government consisting of binding agreements between lords and vassals. The River Freedoms make traditional concepts of feudalism difficult to sustain, but versions of this agreement frequently crop up in unstable regions.</li> <li>Gerontocracy: Rule determined by the eldest\u2014usually a group of elders, rather than the single oldest person.</li> <li>Gynarchy:  Explicit rule by females. See \u201cmatriarchy.\u201d</li> <li>Kleptocracy Rule by thieves; a system of governance where its officials and the ruling class in general pursue personal wealth and political power at the expense of the wider population. In strict terms kleptocracy is not a form of government but a characteristic of a government engaged in such behavior.  Informal government: Pitax</li> <li>Kritocracy/Kritarchy:  Rule by judges. The former is rule by a judge\u2019s personal opinion, whereas the latter is rule by comparison to an external standard, such as \u201cnatural rights.\u201d</li> <li>Magocracy:  Rule by secular magical authority, usually a single wizard or sorcerer. Informal government: Sevenarches</li> <li>Matriarchy:  Rule by a mother figure, within a familial social system.</li> <li>Meritocracy:  Government by those who demonstrate talent or ability in a certain position. Formal government: Mivon</li> <li>Militocracy:  System of rule where the military holds full authority (another River Kingdoms favorite). Formal government: Liberthane, Touvette</li> <li>Monarchy:  Government where supreme authority is held by one hereditary ruler, typically referred to as a king or queen. Many River Kingdom autocrats declare themselves monarchs. Formal government: Artume</li> <li>Noocracy:  Government by the wise, the learned or the scholarly.</li> <li>Ochlocracy:  Rule by a mob with no formal authority.</li> <li>Oligarchy:  Rule by an elite few. Formal government: Cordelon, Gralton, Sevenarches</li> <li>Patriarchy: Rule by a single father figure, within a familial social system.</li> <li>Plutocracy:  Rulership by the rich. Although the wealthy always have power over government, plutocracy is explicit, literal rule by the wealthiest.</li> <li>Republic:  A form of government where the people ruled can indirectly affect the government through representatives. Formal government: Outsea, Protectorate of the Black Marquis</li> <li>Syndicracy: Rule by a business group.</li> <li>Theocracy: Though technically meaning direct rule by a deity, theocracy is often defined as rule by clergy who act on a deity\u2019s dictates.

In 4693 AR, a Taldan prospector named Loric led an expedition into the Wyvernkill, in search of the rich mineral veins there. It ended in disaster: a third of his men were killed in goblin raids, and Loric was forced to retreat in shame. He returned again (much poorer) with a larger and better equipped army of mercenaries, and spent six years scouring the Fells of its monstrous humanoid population. At first the lords of the River Kingdom did not take Loric seriously, but his dogged determination (and the great quantity of goblin standards he brought to the Outlaw Council every year) was enough to earn their respect. In 4700 AR, the Outlaw Council named Loric lord of the region and renamed it the Loric Fells.</p> <p>The suppression of the goblin population had an unplanned side effect: the troll tribes, led by a coven of green hags, led a successful campaign against the Worg Queen, driving her out of the Rookwarden Fortress.

They rightly fear such an event, for Rostland is smaller than Issia, it has fewer armies, and its rolling hills and grasslands offer very little in the way of natural defenses.

Winters are long and deadly here, forcing common folk to scratch out a meager existence farming the near- frozen soil and fishing its rivers and lakes during an all- too-short spring and summer. All the while, the lords of the land plot in their keeps and strongholds, jealously eyeing their neighbors\u2019 domains. This is the nation of Brevoy.</p> <p>The northern half of Brevoy consists of the once- independent nation of Issia. A stark landscape of sparsely vegetated, rugged hills, the region exhibits a uniformly poor quality of the soil that makes it nearly impossible to grow anything here. The people live primarily on fish from the Lake of Mists and Veils, a diet supplemented by food shipped up from Rostland or areas farther south. In centuries past, the people of Issia were infamous raiders, and their river-raiding craft were feared along the length of the Sellen. South of the Gronzi Forest lies Rostland, a vast rolling plain of fertile grasslands, dotted with farms and small villages, and serving as breadbasket of the north and homeland of the Aldori swordpact.</p> <p>On the whole, Issians are a reclusive and enigmatic bunch. Each village has its own traditions dating back hundreds of years. Outsiders find themselves distrusted and shunned. Rumors of bloody rituals and human sacrifice remain unsubstantiated, but in the faraway cities of Restov and New Stetven, people whisper that the true masters of Issia remain hidden beneath the waters of the Lake of Mists and Veils, emerging in the dead of night to strike terrible bargains with the villagers.</p> <p>The people of Rostland are mainly farmers, craftsmen, and tradesmen. Most are outgoing, happy, and welcoming of strangers\u2014as long as the strangers are willing to conform to the local customs, of which there are many. This apparent welcome is somewhat misleading, however, as the people of Rostland are obsessed with honor and personal standing and take offense at the slightest provocation. One wrong word is likely to find the offender in front of the local magistrate or facing a prospective duel. But if outsiders take the trouble to learn their customs, Rostlanders prove to be fast friends and staunch allies.</p> <p>For more than a thousand years, the Surtovas ruled the lands of Issia along the central southern banks of the Lake of Mists and Veils. This long-lived family of pirates and scoundrels is known to be made up of crafty schemers. Lacking both natural resources and a large population, Issia has never possessed anything like a mighty military force, and has traditionally survived by outsmarting its enemies.</p> <p>While the Issians toiled in the northern reaches of this harsh landscape, the much more forgiving southern plains were colonized by Taldan explorers, arriving under the leadership of Baron Sirian First, a fiery, impulsive noble forced to emigrate from Taldor after losing one too many duels. They named this realm Rostland. In the early days of the colony, bandits struck from hidden camps in the River Kingdoms, nearly destroying the budding colony before it had a chance to get started. The bandit leader was himself a master swordsman and challenged the baron to a wager: half the baron\u2019s fortune against the bandit\u2019s head. Unable to pass up the challenge, Baron First took the wager and was broadly humiliated by an ignoble defeat. After he paid the bandit, he disappeared for several years. Most assumed he had fled to another land, too ashamed to show his face after such a defeat.</p> <p>The people were surprised when the baron returned several years later a changed man, a swordsman the likes of whom the world had never before seen. Calling himself Sirian Aldori, he promptly challenged the bandit lord to a rematch, whereupon he disarmed and defeated the bandit in seconds. Re-establishing his rule, Baron Aldori issued an open challenge of 100,000 gp to anyone who could beat him in a duel of swords. Thousands answered the challenge from across the world. Some were earnest and honourable duellists, while others tried to cheat with magic or other tricks. It didn\u2019t matter. Sirian defeated them all, forever cementing his reputation as the greatest swordsman in the world. At first, Sirian refused to teach his techniques, but eventually he selected a small group to train. He made them change their names to Aldori and to swear an oath not to reveal anything they learned to someone not of the swordpact. Through the generations that followed, Sirian\u2019s pupils became known as the Aldori swordlords, a force feared throughout the continent.</p> <p>Then, in 4499 ar, the delicate balance of power between Issia and Rostland fractured as a mysterious Iobarian warlord named Choral the Conqueror stormed into the region at the head of an army and with the allegiance of several red dragons.

Today, Cheliax is a nation without hope\u2014a decadent empire weakened by losses in glory and colonial wealth but deluded with pretensions of greatness spurred on by the infernal court and its fell adherents. It is a stain on the face of Golarion and a mockery of what was once the greatest kingdom of mankind. Yet the common folk of Cheliax are grateful for the salvation the House of Thrune engineered for the dying nation, and if an oppressive government and diabolical church are the price of civilization and the prevention of an even greater civil war, most of the nation\u2019s citizens are only too glad to pay and serve. Alas, such servitude often comes in the form of slavery. Halflings, in particular, suffer in this regard; known as \u201cslips,\u201d they are treated with scorn and contempt. Tieflings are seen as worse than rabble, fleshly proof of a lapse of control over diabolic temptation, and when they appear in public, they do so invariably as exotic slaves or furtive criminals.</p> <p>Imperial Cheliax dominated Avistan for more than 600 years after Chelish King Aspex the Even-Tongued broke from Taldor, diplomatically absorbed Andoran, and conquered both Isger and Galt. These events launched a centuries-long tradition of expansion and glory, propelling Cheliax to the height of human civilization. The nation soon dominated and subsumed many native peoples and cultures, so that many regions had a ruling elite or caste of Chelish origin, or with a strong Chelish heritage and blood ties running back to the empire. The empire continued to expand, and with the expected return of Aroden, patron god of Cheliax, none of the Chelish people had any doubt that it would eventually attain the power (and riches) of ancient Azlant.</p> <p>Then the inexplicable occurred. Instead of returning, Aroden died, and a part of Cheliax died with him. With the emperor stripped of his divine mandate, certain powerful noble houses rose up, plunging the imperial heartland into civil war. Anarchy and war plagued Cheliax for more than 30 years, until House Thrune and its allies took and held the throne. Queen Abrogail I, Infernal Majestrix of Cheliax, placed among her armies bound devils from the depths of Hell. She quelled dissent in the empire\u2019s heartland and in so doing gained her new regime a measure of respect and legitimacy. Few among the gods-fearing citizens of Cheliax approved of the diabolists\u2019 fearsome methods, but wherever they installed themselves, the opportunistic savagery of the last generation soon ceased, and a dark peace embraced the kingdom. Shortly after taking control of the nation, the new government moved its administrative center to the inland port city of Egorian and wasted little time in demanding subservience from Imperial Cheliax\u2019s many holdings. For several months, the new regime not only maintained the borders of Imperial Cheliax but also stood poised to expand beyond them. Unfortunately for the Egorian government, though, the infernal blasphemies of House Thrune turned public opinion against Cheliax.</p> <p>The people of Galt and Andoran rose up and threw off Cheliax\u2019s imperial shackles. Reluctantly, House Thrune allowed these vassals to secede, focusing its attentions on the lucrative colonies of Sargava in Garund and Anchor\u2019s End in distant Arcadia.</p> <p>Despite losing almost half its holdings, Cheliax remains one of the largest nations on Golarion. The far-reaching influence of Cheliax stretches north to the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, south to the nation of Sargava in Garund, and east into Taldor and Qadira. Elements of Chelish culture appear in all those places and more, mostly in the ports and trading cities of dozens of nations\u2014indeed, art, theater, and music (particularly the opera) have seen a striking explosion in popularity in modern Cheliax, if only because the nation\u2019s beleaguered citizens increasingly need an escape from reality.</p>","tags":["Place","Nation"]},{"location":"Places/Nation/Cheliax/#people","title":"People","text":"<p>Chelaxians thrive on the southwestern portion of Avistan, and the exploits of their once-mighty empire spread Chelish seed throughout the Inner Sea region.

They have a flair for organization, and as a result, soon came to dominate their large corner of Avistan. They undercut the power of, and later successfully rebelled against, the elder Taldan Empire, and soon dominated the surrounding regions either directly or indirectly, forming the Empire of Cheliax. They even successfully removed the center of worship of the god Aroden from Taldor to their empire, and spread both north into Varisia and south into Garund in a series of conf licts known as the Everwar.</p> <p>The inherent self-confidence of the Chelaxians, instilled from birth, served them well at the time of their favored god\u2019s death and the devastating civil war that followed. Modern Chelaxians believe they are inherently more capable of handling any situation than other races\u2014this might take the form of either helpful, positive advice or arrogant dismissal of rival viewpoints. Their aggressive attitude causes them to persevere even in desperate straits.</p> <p>This self-assurance is bolstered by a long, rich heritage and a love for learning, which manifests in theology, arcane studies, and mechanical invention. Chelaxian specialists are particularly capable in discovering, developing, and adapting new techniques revealed by their own research or learned from other cultures.</p> <p>Chelaxians favor rich trappings both in their homes and on their persons. Popular outfits include velvet or silk gowns or doublets with rich brocades and lace trim, often covered with a cloak of a rare and valuable color or made from the hide of some uncommon creature. In more hostile climes, they prefer inscribed armor (often of dwarven manufacture) and filigreed weapons with rich and detailed provenances. This is not to say that, when money is tight or circumstances dictate, they are above traveling in civilian clothes or mixing with the common-folk in order to avoid difficult circumstances. They never sacrifice their bearing, however, and cannot hide their confidence.</p> <p>Chelaxians venerate those heroes who embody their values: strength, nobility, ambition, and\u2014most of all\u2014 success. Chelaxian heroes tend to be accepted into the larger community with titles, grants of land, and marriage into the more respectable houses. By the same token, those heroes deemed a threat to the local ruling class are watched and, if necessary, removed, either by sending them on quests to other areas or quietly, in the dead of night.</p> <p>As a people, Chelaxians are serious about oaths, contracts, and promises, and they believe in playing by the rules, all the while checking for loopholes to best subvert those rules. They tend to organize themselves and to work together toward a common goal, taking direction from an established and recognized leader. Such a talent for organization has served well among the empire\u2019s legions in its conquests, though the nation is not immune to periodic rebellions and unrest. A common joke is that while Varisians might form an angry mob, Chelaxians instead create a well-ordered, disapproving queue.</p> <p>Chelaxians have a common first name and a family name or surname. Family and lineage are very important to a Chelaxian, and those of particular power or legendary ability might gain a sobriquet as well (such as \u201cthe wise,\u201d \u201cthe open-handed,\u201d or \u201cthe rat-biter\u201d).

Throughout 6 centuries of Chelish rule, Galt drew freethinkers and idealists to its universities and clever rogues and scoundrels to its woods. Today, only one color comes to mind when people think of Galt: the bitter crimson of blood. The Red Revolution has held the land in its grip for more than 40 years, and it shows no signs of ending.</p> <p>The seeds of the Red Revolution were sown when House Thrune rose to power in Cheliax. The poet Darl Jubannich issued the broadsheet series On Government, which used Thrune practices as the foundation from which to undermine the basic principle of the divine right of kings. The half-elf philosopher Hosetter took thing even further: his Imperial Betrayal urged the common folk to take up arms to defend their shared ideals. These fiery words spread swiftly across the land, and the tales of Queen Abrogail\u2019s cruelty only added fuel to the flames. Dissent soon burst into rebellion, and rebellion into full revolt. Tens of thousands answered Hosetter\u2019s call, coming together in rowdy mobs to shatter any remnant of Chelish rule and drag the decadent nobles from their manors. Together with other heroes of the people, Hosetter and Jubannich formed the Revolutionary Council, one of the first acts of which was to commission the creation of the final blades. Citizen Margaery San Trayne was the architect of these mystical guillotines; she called for a tool that would bring \u201ca swift and humane end, offering no escape through the magics of resurrection\u2014and furthermore, keeping even the vilest Galtan soul from falling into the clutches of a Chelish devil.\u201d</p> <p>Hosetter and Jubannich acted with the best of intentions, but the child they brought into the world quickly grew into a monster. The love of life that once characterized Galt became an endless thirst for blood. Those who criticized the Revolutionary Council found themselves branded Chelish sympathizers and set upon the tumbrel to face the final blade. The united front of the revolutionary leaders soon shattered into paranoia and infighting, with new demagogues rising to challenge the established leaders. The collapse of the social order exacerbated these problems, and mobs turned to new leaders in the hopes of miraculous change. Just 5 years after chairing the first session of the Revolutionary Council, Hosetter was executed in his hometown of Edme. Darl Jubannich fled to Andoran, and with his departure the last voice of reason was drowned out by the hungry mob.</p> <p>Galt has seen more than a dozen governments rise and fall since Hosetter\u2019s death, and all they have shared is bloodshed, chaos, and eventual collapse. The beautiful galleries and lofty universities of Galt have been destroyed; its people are driven by paranoia, fury, and a bitter refusal to recognize the cause of their troubles; and the collapse of any organized army has allowed brigands and savage beasts to thrive in the wilds. At the same time, Galt\u2019s neighbors fear that the rhetoric of Korran Goss might send the bloodthirsty Galtan mobs spilling out across the borders. In the early days of the Revolution, neighboring Andoran offered shelter to refugees from all walks of life; today it fears the growing darkness, and soldiers spread throughout the Verduran Forest turn back any Galtan who seeks passage into their land, rendering passage through the region via the Sellen River, a heavily used trade route, an increasingly dangerous prospect.

As the demon pressed north and encountered Iadara, however, he discovered the true scope of his opportunity. With whispered feelers probing the minds of the remaining elves, he learned of the Sovyrian Stone, and set about trying to corrupt it, attempting to break its connection to the elves\u2019 strange refuge and use its power to bring Golarion in line with the Abyss, opening its gates to the demonic hordes.</p> <p>In faraway Sovyrian, the elves felt the shift and took action.

The wilderness between the steadings is also dominated by fey creatures and linnorms, for rifts between Golarion and the First World run through this land. Fey creatures are common here, along with gnomes, azatas, trolls, and nature spirits. There are enchanted animals that can both plead for their lives and utter dire curses against their attackers, and more deadly creatures as well. The most dangerous of these otherworldly creatures are the legendary linnorms, vast beasts said to be Golarion\u2019s first dragons, and the beasts a warlord must slay if he is to become a Linnorm King.</p> <p>The vast reach of land occupying the northwestern corner of Avistan has long been the home of the Linnorm Kings. No one is quite sure where the first Linnorm Kings came from\u2014they were certainly in power long before the first explorers from the south ventured into the rugged northlands. The Linnorm Kings are not only masters of this harsh realm, but of the sea itself. As early as \u2013473 ar, Linnorm King Ulvass led a fleet of barbarians west to discover Arcadia and establish Valenhall as an earthly paradise. Through the ages that followed, stories of exceptional Ulfen have emerged\u2014but for most of Avistan, the legends and tales of Ulfen raiders on dragon- headed longboats are what haunt dreams and capture the imagination.</p> <p>The single greatest defeat and shame to visit the Lands of the Linnorm Kings remains the Winter War of 3313. It took less than 30 days for the Queen of Witches, Baba Yaga, to carve away the eastern reaches of these lands and claim them as her own nation of Irrisen, a defeat that the Linnorm Kings still seethe over. Yet Irrisen\u2019s borders are well defended, and as long as the Linnorm Kings remain divided, they have no hope of reclaiming their lost lands.</p>","tags":["Place","Nation"]},{"location":"Places/Nation/Lands-of-the-Linnorm-Kings/#people","title":"People","text":"<p>The days of easy pillage from the south are mostly over, as Ulfen raiders can no longer pass through the Arch of Aroden into the Inner Sea unaccosted. At the same time, the Ulfen are increasingly hired as sailors, marines, and bodyguards throughout Avistan, perhaps because they combine great seamanship, ruthlessness, and exotic looks.</p> <p>Ulfen men and women set great store by personal appearance, valuing their flowing locks, tight braids, and well-kept furs of ermine, mink, and fox. They wear necklaces of amber, carved narwhal horn, and mammoth ivory, as well as finely worked bronze and silver in a braided style. They consider themselves the handsomest men and women in all Avistan, and the damnable thing about it, to other peoples, is that they are often right.</p> <p>Ulfen hailing from the Lands of the Linnorm Kings are typically sailors and traders; those from the Irrisen lands ruled by Baba Yaga are more often riders than sailors, although they share cultural ties. The Ulfen traditionally keep thralls\u2014slaves whose period of service ends in a set amount of time. Children born to thralls are always born free, and thralls can file a complaint against a harsh or unfair master (which shames the master, certainly, but also runs the risk of a master\u2019s fury). Thralls have been either captured in battle or condemned to service by a thingmar, a court of justice of the Ulfen consisting of the victim\u2019s peers, overseen by an elder jarl or chief. Even chiefs or jarls can be condemned as thralls if they have foresworn an oath, killed a child, or betrayed their fellow warriors.</p> <p>Ulfen men are fond of competitions both athletic and alcoholic. Their athletic contests often occur at the approach of winter or the start of spring and include climbing ice walls, hurling timbers of various sizes, axe throwing, sled pulls, and races on foot and on snowshoes. Swimming is not a skill that Ulfens value, although sailing and rowing are. The drinking competitions happen during great feasts, when the Ulfen men boast of their ability to down kegs or even barrels of mead, ale, and cider. Outsiders tend to take away from this a view that Ulfen are boors and louts, which is not entirely true. Their boorish loutishness tends to be conf ined to special occasions such as feast days\u2014Ulfen men who try this approach at other times find that Ulfen women mock them mercilessly. Few care to repeat the experience.</p> <p>Ulfen women are often powerful druids and priestesses of Desna or Torag. The men are most often rangers and barbarians, and worship Erastil, Gorum, or Torag, although they have druids and priests of Desna among their numbers as well. As a group, the Ulfen are more adventurous than most\u2014the wilderness of the Linnorm Kings and Irrisen is too thinly settled for anyone to live long who cannot prosper in the wild and find food and shelter when bad weather sets in. Yet most Ulfen are not heroes, but rather trappers, hunters, farmers, and fisherfolk, according to the season and their own family heritage.</p> <p>In general, dueling and feuding are popular pastimes among the Ulfen, with great emphasis on personal honor and the value of a sworn oath. Insults are usually answered with axe and shield pushes, and while dueling is always considered purely a temporary argument, fought to the first blood and forgotten as soon as it is over, feuding is a more serious thing. In a feud among the Ulfen, entire families and clans can go to war over a conf lict as simple as the proper way to mend nets or the rights to a particular salmon spawning ground. Sheep and cattle raiding are also popular pastimes.</p> <p>Finally, no discussion of the Ulfen would be complete without mention of the high incidence of lycanthropy among them. The curse of lycanthropy is not considered an especially dishonorable state among the Ulfen, but rather a mark of favor from nature spirits. During the full moon, those who suffer from it and cannot control their violent urges are required to stay in a longhouse or spirit house, which is barred with silver and stocked with enough food to satiate even the largest appetite. </p>","tags":["Place","Nation"]},{"location":"Places/Nation/Mendev/","title":"Mendev","text":"<p>The nation of Mendev (pronounced MEN-dev) in northeastern Avistan was a land long defined by its conflict with the Abyssal forces of the Worldwound.

The fortunes of the crusaders rose and fell until a seeming miracle occurred: a small group of heroes completed a ritual to close the portal to the Abyss. With their reinforcements cut off and the demon lord Deskari slain, the demons retreated. The crusaders pressed their advantage and brought a successful end to the Fifth Mendevian Crusade in 4713 AR. With the end of the war, Queen Galfrey stepped down and appointed Chancellor Irahai, a civilian, to rule Mendev. The nation is now dealing with the aftermath of the war, defeating the remaining demons of the Sarkoris Scar, reclaiming the corrupted lands they left behind, and managing its own internal struggles with its few, war-depleted resources.</p>","tags":["Place","Nation"]},{"location":"Places/Nation/Mendev/#history","title":"History","text":"<p>Tales of demonic monstrosities spewing from the distant north spread swiftly throughout Avistan at the dawn of the Age of Lost Omens. The \u201cSong of Sarkoris\u201d related the fall of a wicked barbarian kingdom to horrors from the Great Beyond. \u201cThe Ballad of Prince Zhakar\u201d told of the brave march into a chaos-warped land by a band of Mendevian heroes who died one by one fighting their way to the center of the blight, a \u201cwound in the world.\u201d Ministers of congregations shaken by the death of Aroden seized upon songs like these and reports of vile creatures from the north, whipping their followers into a frenzy of religious fervor. A crusade surged north to Mendev to combat the demon-plague of the Worldwound, but in their fervor to save the world, these self-same crusaders may well destroy the nation of Mendev in the process.</p> <p>Before the crusades, most northerners knew nothing of Mendev, a proud kingdom descended from Iobarian exiles and ne\u2019er-do-wells. As related in the tale that still fuels new recruits to the crusade, Mendev\u2019s last prince died in the ruins of Sarkoris, near the rupture in reality known as the Worldwound. During the first few years of the Age of Lost Omens, the Worldwound\u2019s growth stood unopposed\u2014yet as word spread of the demonic incursion, crusaders took up the call to defend the land. The clergy of Iomedae led the way, stepping out from the shadows of their bewildered masters in the faltering church of Aroden. Nobles in Cheliax, Isger, and Andoran, fearing growing domestic discontent fueled by dispossessed nobles and idle mercenaries roaming their countrysides, joined with the Iomedaean church to sponsor the first Mendevian Crusade in 4622 ar. Thousands of pilgrims soon made their way up the River Road from Cassomir to Chesed and across the Lake of Mists and Veils to Mendev, where they joined battle and the demonic hordes were checked and even pushed back. The crusaders fortif ied their gains\u2019 and for almost a generation the frontier was quiet. The crusade was deemed a rousing success.</p> <p>Talk of an easy victory was silenced, however, when the demons, having assembled a massive force, renewed their onslaught. The crusaders suffered horrifying defeats as the land itself seemed to shift and change beneath them, and the demons rode a wave of chaos into and through their lines. This disastrous invasion, including the total loss of the northern fortress-city of Drezen in 4638, triggered a Second Crusade. The crusaders once more threw back the demonic onslaught, and with the demons pushed back, the crusaders devised a new stratagem. A string of rune-encrusted menhirs known as wardstones was constructed to keep the worst of the demonic land\u2019s inhabitants and influence from spreading. The stones must be maintained with careful prayer and ritual, and remain constant points of attack by demons and their servants.</p> <p>With their armies temporarily contained, the clever demons changed tactics yet again, and through a campaign of careful infiltration, seduction, and betrayal they began to undermine the fragile alliances that held together the crusade. This more subtle campaign produced several crusader defeats, but more importantly it succeeded in inf laming suspicion and paranoia in Mendev. The uneasiness is worst in the border town of Kenabres, where the aging prophet Hulrun leads a zealous pogrom against demon worshipers, and his passion for inquisition remains undimmed by the passing years. In truth, much of the Third Crusade seemed nearly as concerned with purifying the citizenry and the hinterlands of Mendev as with matters on the front lines. As far back as the First Crusade, many immigrating crusaders suspected the native Iobarian culture and its druidic faith of being demon-tainted. Hundreds of indigenous Mendevians and pilgrims have been burned at the stake in Kenabres alone since these trials began. Crusader leaders in the past turned a blind eye to this cruelty, preferring to focus on military matters, but the Order of Heralds instituted with the Fourth Crusade has made considerable strides in curbing the inquisition. Even in Kenabres, the ardor of the inquisition has dimmed somewhat, and many hope it will be utterly extinguished with the death of the aged prelate\u2014but quietly here and there throughout Mendev, the screaming flames still echo the passion of her most fervent zealots.</p> <p>Today, Mendev is a land of duality, a shining bastion of law and goodness hard up against the Worldwound, a burgeoning sinkhole of evil that threatens all of creation. It is a land of pilgrims, crusaders, opportunistic rogues, and a simmering clash of cultures from south and north. Foreigners engaged in the holy wars against the blight of the Worldwound now outnumber the native people of Mendev, who have been pushed aside and treated as an underclass by the nation\u2019s new inhabitants. Queen Galfrey inspires hope that the Fourth Crusade will return attention to the true enemy and the ideals of the crusade\u2014 and rid the north of the taint of otherworldly evil. Throughout Avistan and beyond, men and women of strong character and boundless ambition still look to the north with purpose and determination, and in their mouths the Acts of Iomedae are no mere words or stories, but a holy calling. Still, stability is fragile in Mendev, and a real brutality and lawlessness lurks just below the surface. All the while, slowly but surely, the reality-bending chaos of the Worldwound consumes more of the world, spreading its malign influence ever southward. Sooner or later, the wardstones will fail.

They are also known to be perhaps the most arrogant, self- important, and dismissive culture in history. Both these reputations are well deserved.</p> <p>On the shores of the Inner Sea sits the kingdom of Taldor, the oldest of the surviving Avistani nations in the region. From its humble beginnings as a trading post where Azlanti fleeing the devastation of their homeland could exchange goods with Keleshites living on the frontier of ancient desert empires, Taldor grew to become a world power in its own right. At one time, the Empire of Taldor spanned most of southern Avistan, north to the River Kingdoms, and west through most of modern Cheliax. Yet today the kingdom of Taldor is a mere fraction of its former size.</p> <p>Despite the loss of their empire, Taldans retain an arrogance and aloof spirit more befitting a people at the height of their power and influence. Wealthy merchants, royals, and landowners across the Inner Sea do their best to cultivate the style, air, and sophistication of Taldor, but observers can always tell the difference between a poseur and the genuine article. The way a Taldan man wears his neatly trimmed beard is as much a birthright as a matter of grooming. And the elaborate, ribbon-festooned wigs worn by the women are heirlooms passed down from generation to generation.</p> <p>Outsiders sometimes find it difficult to fit into Taldan society. The local populace considers anyone who does not have the advantage of Taldan birth and training to be hopelessly provincial, an opinion they express loudly and often. They generally seem to be of the opinion that anything of importance must happen in Taldor and, conversely, anything that happens outside the kingdom must be trivial and banal.</p> <p>Taldans justifiably take pride in the strong influence their native gods have exerted across not just the Inner Sea region, but across most of Golarion. Of the 20 most widely worshiped deities, four hail originally from Taldan traditions or were themselves Taldan in their mortal lives: Abadar, Cayden Cailean, Norgorber, and Shelyn. Taldans gladly point out to anyone around that two of the three mortals who ascended to godhood thanks to the power of the Starstone are of Taldan descent. By the same token, they become petulant whenever someone has the bad manners to point out that the third and most widely worshiped of the ascendant gods\u2014Iomedae the Inheritor\u2014is of Chelish stock.</p> <p>Taldan arrogance manifests differently for the two sexes. Male Taldans exhibit an overbearing machismo that usually falls just shy of outright misogyny. They speak of conquests and territorial disputes when they discuss Taldan women, and of \u201cbringing civilization to the barbarians\u201d to brag of their exploits with women of other ethnicities or races. Taldan women express their ethnic superiority complex via biting commentary of the dress, hairstyle, body shape, or facial features of other females they see. Although they tend to focus their overly critical judgments on women from other ethnicities or races, when bored or among only close friends they sometimes casually insult one another (albeit with considerably less bile than when their attentions are drawn outside their close circles). Obviously, not every Taldan exhibits the most extreme arrogant personality traits described here, but enough do to make the pride of Taldans an unfavorable stereotype known throughout the Inner Sea region.</p> <p>On the other hand, when moved to better emotions, Taldans express their concerns with nigh-unparalleled charity of time and wealth. In fact, the success with which wide-eyed impoverished children (especially those of obviously Taldan descent) and those with hard-luck tales can convince a Taldan to donate hard-earned coins further leads to the view among others that Taldans throw about their wealth with little concern for the future.

In victory, the warlord divided his nation between his lieutenants and allies, creating holdings befitting the deeds and merit of their ancient families. For more than 500 years, the newly risen Kingdom of Ustalav followed the horned crown of the Ustav line, yet as generations passed, the clannish Varisians quarreled endlessly over territory, familial rights, and the honor of long-dead ancestors. In the face of civil war, King Kaldemov divided the nation into 16 counties, formally establishing the domains of the land\u2019s most inf luential families and granting them broad administrative powers, so long as they remained loyal to and met the demands of the crown.</p> <p>The country enjoyed several brief centuries of peace after its division\u2014a never-reclaimed golden age in its tormented past.

While the people waged a desperate defense, every fallen soldier bolstered the strength of the undead ranks, and by 3206, Ustalav was a realm dominated by the dead. For more than 600 years, the Whispering Tyrant ruled an empire of abominations rooted in the country\u2019s corpse.

But, with the line of Soividia Ustav long broken, the crown came to rest with families claiming at best tenuous ties to the ancient hero\u2014resulting in an era of slow recovery, infighting, and weak rulers. The land too had changed, as had the creatures afoot in those reaches. Although the Whispering Tyrant had been defeated, his minions proved subtle and unnaturally patient, hiding themselves amid the darkest shadows and haunting ruins left in the wake of an age of anguish. Forgotten enemies of Ustalav also prowled from the shadows once more\u2014beasts thought to be mere legends and the unquiet spirits of slaughtered Kellid ritualists.

Arranged according to some arcane design, seven arches stand in the clearing, carved from gray-brown basalt quarried nowhere in the River Kingdoms. Time and nature have challenged but not defeated the true arches. Vines climb the sides, and moss half covers the stone carvings of animals and magical beasts. Each arch is a different size and shape; the highest towers 50 feet overhead and 30 feet wide, brushing the lower forest canopy, hinting at the size of what could be summoned through it. Those who sense magic find the arches\u2019 presence nearly overwhelming, bright as bonfires on a moonless night. Others find the clearing unsettling, possessed of a high ringing in the ears, or a vague acrid smell. </p> <p>Ten thousand years ago, these arches were powerful gates to strange places, including the First World, and the elves used them freely. Now they have somehow become mistuned, perhaps leading to otherworld realms, but certainly degenerated into portals of fey disease that disgorge evil monstrosities known as the gorgas. Gorgas come in a bewildering variety of animalistic shapes, but all have teeth, claws, and eyes of pure shadow. The sacred charge of the Oakstewards is to protect Golarion from the gorgas that emerge from these portals. What else can be summoned through is a mystery to all but the Oakstewards.</p> <p>The Oakstewards have also learned that elves who come near the portals are stricken with an unnatural plague, one which not even the druids can treat or cure. Known as the Obnubilate Plague, the malady destroys not only an elf \u2019s body, but also his memory. Oaksteward lore says the plague is highly contagious, so the druids do not allow infected elves to leave the clearing again, lest they pass it on to others of their kind. The druids suspect that a cure might lie on the other side of one of the portals, but none of their exploratory parties have ever returned, and they don't even know if their search parties chose the right portal. </p> <p>Every few human generations, a band of elves breaks through the Oakstewards\u2019 protections intent on reclaiming their former holding. The arches become more active when elves are nearby\u2014the gorgas on the other side of the portals can sense their approach. This is detrimental to both the elves (as the plague strikes quickly) and the kingdom of Sevenarches (since the gorgas ravage the kingdom until the Oakstewards can slay or banish them). </p> <p>For these reasons, the Oakstewards ban elves from entering Sevenarches. They dare not even explain their motive, because they believe Kyonin\u2019s Queen Edasseril and her court will be too proud to listen to mere human counsel. Believing in their own ability to handle the dangers, the Oakstewards think the elves would bring in an army and unwittingly spread the Obnubilate Plague to every elf on Golarion.

As his people fled the firestorm that destroyed their beloved home, Athanasius vowed to found a new city, one that kept his people safe through the Three Precepts of his assassins: Life, Death, and the Vessel Between. After battling his way through the nations of Casmaron, shrugging off skirmishes in Brevoy, and leading his people through the bandit-infested River Kingdoms, Athanasius finally came to a small town on a hill overlooking the Sellen River. It had everything he needed: ample farmland, river access to the sea, and a defensible position. He gave the residents of the small town (then called Rivermark) the choice to flee, join, or die. Most chose to join.</p> <p>Over the centuries, Athanasius and his progeny built Daggermark into a fortress town with double curtain walls, a fortified dock, and a heavily patrolled road system that fed farm and free range goods into the city. They established a school for assassins, plainly called the Daggermark Assassins' Guild, that trained anyone willing to be taught in the methods of the Yenchabur warriors. This nearly lost art was a rare fighting style comprised of stealth, agility, and secrecy that turned a man or woman into a holy warrior called the Vessel Between (so named because the Yenchabur quietly escort their targets from the kingdom of the living to the kingdom of the dead). The citizens of Daggermark, under the leadership of the Yenchabur, rid every inch of the nearby plains and woods of bandits, and for a while life in Daggermark was ordinary.</p> <p>Everything changed 90 years ago when a Chelish poisoner settled in Daggermark. Count Ambras Imre was escaping the turmoil of his homeland, seeking a place to practice his illegal art. In no time after arriving, he\u2019d established the Daggermark Poisoners\u2019 Guild, allied himself with the Yenchabur at the Daggermark Assassins\u2019 Guild (after agreeing to teach them his methods), and possibly killed the last King of Daggermark\u2014for within a few months of Imre\u2019s arrival, His Supreme Highness Athanasius XIII choked to death at dinner and was unresurrectable.</p> <p>During the ensuing upheaval, the two guilds organized things a great deal from their end.

They dubbed this the Outlaw Council, and the year after Athanasius\u2019s death, despite the chaos of the City of Assassins, the Outlaw Council met for the first time and officially codified the Six River Freedoms (which had already held informal sway for generations). Specifically, the representatives of Daggermark championed the Fourth Freedom (\u201cCourts are for Kings\u201d), showing that a deep rift had been building for some time between the nobility of Daggermark and the common citizens, oddly represented by the Yenchabur assassins and the newly formed poisoners\u2019 guild.</p> <p>Thereafter, Daggermark fell into anarchy, led by no one but occasionally organized through mob rule, or at least widespread consent. This allowed Daggermark to function for a while, but stagnated the city\u2019s growth, and the lack of an organized military in the city led to the rise of banditry. When thousands nearly starved to death in the winter of 4657\u2013 4658, the people started to grumble that maybe bringing back authoritarian rule wouldn\u2019t be such a bad thing.</p> <p>On hearing these grumblings, the assassins\u2019 guild made a strange and city-shaping decision: it announced that student assassins needed work to practice their art. Though the masters were still available for more daring or discreet endeavors, Daggermark citizens could now, for a fair price, hire one of these students to \u201csend a message\u201d to anyone. There were two rules: you could only hire a student assassin once per year from the guild, and you couldn\u2019t target a member of the military for assassination. As the city lacked an official military, the people immediately realized that forming one and joining it would be a good idea, if only to prevent some angry neighbors from ordering their deaths. It was about this time that a man proclaimed himself king\u2014and was killed in half a day. After that, no one tried to use the title \u201cking,\u201d but there were several lords, a few dukes, and even a prime minister. Most were assassinated before the next new moon, leading to the joking title of \u201clord of the new moon.\u201d While few of these lords lasted long, some of them left enough of an impression to help form a stalwart militia, crush the rising banditry, or reestablish trade relations with neighbors. Others simply rose to power, stole what they could, and fled the city. Still others bucked the odds and reigned for a number of years, helping to build and maintain the anarchic peace of Daggermark.</p> <p>Over time, this odd system of assassination-ruled chaos resulted in a stable society. In a given month, five citizens of the Daggermark region die from assassination or poisoning, but murder and similar violent crimes are rare and property crimes are nearly unheard of within the city walls. Daggermark maintains a 1,500-person army of heavy footmen and cavalry; the footmen are commanded by the charismatic dwarf Jallor Clovesh, while the cavalry is controlled by the city\u2019s current uler, Martro Livondar, a shady man who many suspect is only running the city to make money off the endeavor. To prove this rumor, the citizens have tried five times to kill him, three in his first week. These attempts on his life stopped when he declared he was now also the lord captain of the city\u2019s cavalry, making him exempt from assassination. So long as he keeps the city running and isn\u2019t too obvious about his thievery, it\u2019s likely the assassins\u2019 guild will maintain its neutrality. If he gets too obvious, however, the citizens may agitate for a change in the guild\u2019s rules.</p>","tags":["Place","River-Kingdom"]},{"location":"Places/River-Kingdoms/Daggermark-Realm/#sites","title":"Sites","text":"<p>Daggermark Saad Solanas Wilkesmont Shroudwood Hawk's Nest</p>","tags":["Place","River-Kingdom"]},{"location":"Places/River-Kingdoms/Gralton-Realm/","title":"Gralton","text":"<p>The inhabitants of Gralton consist almost entirely of people who have fled the ongoing revolution (some would say anarchy) in Galt.

Unwilling or unable to continue a Galtan life of suffering and fear, many Galtan citizens flee the kingdom to seek a new life outside its borders. Those that make their way to the River Kingdoms find a home in Gralton, a small nation of ex-Galtan nobility, exiles and refugees from the war. There, outside their bloodied homeland, they start anew, though few forget their past and what they left behind.</p> <p>Gralton was carved out of the River Kingdoms by men and women who were no strangers to hardship, physical or emotional. Its founder, Obidas Nauzil, a wealthy bank owner from the Galtan city of Edme, fled Galt when his bank was forcibly taken over. He gathered with him as many friends and other misplaced noblemen as he could, and together they sought a new land to call their own, away from the madness of the Red Revolution. They found it in the River Kingdoms, a small piece of land bisected by the Sellen River. It was already occupied, but the men who lived there were weak and starving, having been attacked by brigands multiple times and had most of their supplies stolen. The occupants foolishly tried to fight off the newcomers but were quickly overpowered, and the land was reclaimed as Little Galt. Nauzil became the mayor of this new town, and he set to work expanding and defending it. As the city grew, things quickly fell out of Nauzil\u2019s control, as he was not prepared to rule what was rapidly becoming a small \u201ckingdom.\u201d In response to the complaints, he appointed an advisory council, and they effectively ruled Gralton until Nauzil\u2019s death 2 years later. The council appointed a new leader, an ambitious man named Hannan Gralt, who was the first to openly suggest that his people organize to reclaim their land in Galt. Under his rule, Little-Galt was renamed Gralton (mostly by ex-noblemen who found the name \u201cLittle-Galt\u201d to be demeaning), and since then the governor and the council have shared somewhat equal rule over the city-state.</p> <p>The most noteworthy event in Gralton\u2019s history since its founding was a large-scale invasion of brigands from the north in 4687. They were repelled before reaching the river, but not before they had set fire to some of Gralton\u2019s farmland, its city hall, and a few residences. Fifteen citizens died, among them Governor Gralt himself. Lord Marnius Cherlorne was appointed his successor, and he worked quickly to quell fears that the huge loss of resources\u2014both from the fire and from the necessary rebuilding and recovery that resulted\u2014would spell an end to Gralton. Now, while Gralton is not thriving, it is certainly surviving, and many Graltoners thank Governor Cherlorne for that.</p> <p>Gralton is still growing as refugees continue to flee Galt, but it is a dangerous trek to Gralton. Forests thick with bandits and roads watched by thieves make up most of the journey. Some escape the bloodshed of the Revolution only to be robbed or killed on the path to relative safety. Those that make it find themselves in a new land with nothing of their own, no wealth or possessions beyond what they can carry. Many become depressed when the full reality of starting from scratch finally hits them. The majority of Gralton citizens were once nobility, unused to having to earn their food and shelter. The first few days in the kingdom are often painful, with newcomers feeling lost, overwhelmed, and defeated. Those few who hope to find a paradise in Gralton quickly lose their illusions and accept that this new life will not be easy, knowing anything is better than Galt in its current state. Those who don\u2019t either perish or are driven out to try to find a place of their own somewhere else.</p> <p>Regardless of previous expectations, each citizen of Gralton finds his own niche in society and works at it as best he can. Blacksmiths, tailors, merchants\u2014many nobility who have never worked a day in their lives soon find themselves with trades of their own, often even working with their hands. They recognize that Gralton needs business to survive, and that without smithies and shops there will be no supplies. They also learn to rely on each other, as everyone is in the same boat. This does not mean, however, that everyone is friendly toward each other, and beneath their strained politeness there is bitterness and rivalry.</p> <p>Gralton is not a pleasant place to make a home. The River Kingdoms are dangerous, and the citizens are desperate and unhappy, mourning the loss of land, wealth, power, possessions, and often friends and family they were forced to leave behind. Most do not intend to live in Gralton indefinitely, and come to the small kingdom looking only for a relatively safe place to plot and gather resources for their return to Galt to take back what they lost. This itself causes much tension, as there are many different plans for returning to Galt which often conflict or require the aid of fellow citizens who have plans of their own. As a result, there is much hostility between residents of Gralton.</p> <p>However, Graltoners\u2019 fear of another civil war is greater than their anger and frustration toward each other, and so they are cautious when arguing over politics and plans. Such discussion is often quiet, wary, and somewhat secret, and generally broken off if it is clear that the two discussing parties greatly disagree. Thus, like-minded people here tend to gravitate toward each other, forming large groups who meet in private to discuss their plans. These groups eventually become secret societies with elaborate schemes to reclaim what was lost in Galt. This way, open arguments and violence are avoided, but at the same time it breeds distrust against those outside these societies.</p> <p>Some Graltoners choose not to follow the societies\u2019 mandate of secrecy and are open about their plans and desires. Even those who are not privileged or interested enough to join a secret society are eager to see change, either in Gralton\u2019s current state or back in Galt. Lord General Halidan Tarne, one of the few ex-nobles of Galt who can rightfully consider himself a noble of Gralton, has been gathering an army in Gralton for years to invade Galt by force and has erected strange, makeshift barracks that can hold 300 of his 500 soldiers. Most of these \u201csoldiers\u201d are not properly trained, despite the efforts of Gallar Porswan an ex-military officer of Galt thought long dead by those back home. What the Gralton soldiers lack in training they make up for in enthusiasm. Driven by dreams of reclaiming old glory and happiness, they would gladly raid Galt, Lord Tarne riding at their head, but travel logistics and lack of a clear target in the old homeland limit their ability to act, and the army is starting to lose soldiers to delays. Occasionally, a smaller group strikes out (led by Tarne or an officer) to hit Galtan towns, but their lack of discipline costs them and they return days later, bloodied and with fewer numbers.</p> <p>Halidan\u2019s cousin Casal Tarne does not agree with the idea of simply raiding Galt, believing that Halidan\u2019s troops should wait to attack until they are more numerous, stronger, and better organized. He worked for years as Halidan\u2019s unofficial advisor but found that his cousin never heeded any of his advice. After the two nearly came to blows, their shaky friendship ended, and now Casal is quietly waiting for Halidan to die in one of his foolish battles, at which point Casal will take over the army. In the meantime, Casal is currently acting as sheriff and heads the city guard.</p> <p>Over the years, the desire to return to Galt has escalated into a kingdom-wide obsession. Secret societies are becoming even more secretive, and much of their scheming has been going in radical and bizarre directions, with plans becoming more and more ludicrous. More people are becoming vocal on the streets, urging their fellow Graltoners to take action with a frightening intensity. Those who stand up and openly try to build an army of their own are either assimilated or driven out by Tarne\u2019s men. Similarly, many citizens are turning to religious fanaticism, hoping the gods will help them in their mission. Nearly two dozen temples to Calistria have been built in the last 4 years, crowding out and sometimes forcibly taking over temples of other gods. Adding a bit of confusion to the general hostility present is the fact that regardless of radically differing opinions on how to reclaim what was lost, the goals of most of the citizens are very nearly the same. Citizens must also rely on each other to keep Gralton alive, and many Graltoners owe their lives to their fellows due to frequent bandit attacks or similar near-tragedies.</p> <p>Gralton is known to be a desperate place, and its reputation draws outsiders who hope to take advantage of such emotional people. Religious speakers, swindlers, and self-proclaimed miracle-workers flock to the small kingdom seeking followers or a fast fortune. Unscrupulous peddlers come from other parts of the River Kingdoms or more distant lands, bringing cheap medicines and good luck charms that are usually worthless, as well as maps and news of unreliable quality. False prophets foretell doom or peace, speaking of disappointed gods, necessary sacrifices, and great change. The people of Gralton welcome such visitors and eagerly supply them with business. When those visitors leave Gralton, they spread stories of its strange, distraught people, their odd behavior\u2014a false politeness that can be chilling\u2014and the locals\u2019 obsession with some great return to Galt. As a result, rumors abound that Gralton is not normal, and that its people are possessed by vengeful spirits, or perhaps even by Calistria herself.</p>","tags":["Place","River-Kingdom"]},{"location":"Places/River-Kingdoms/Gralton-Realm/#sites","title":"Sites","text":"<p>Gralton</p>","tags":["Place","River-Kingdom"]},{"location":"Places/River-Kingdoms/Hymbria/","title":"Hymbria","text":"<p>This woodland kingdom was established by Kyonin as a base of operations for elven interests in the River Kingdoms. \u00a0Only elves dedicated to the reclamation of Sevenarches are allowed beneath the trees of this secretive outpost.</p>","tags":["Place","River-Kingdom"]},{"location":"Places/River-Kingdoms/Hymbria/#history","title":"History","text":"<p>Just to the south of the Embeth Forest lies a dense woodland.

A fledgling domain called Alban lasted only a few generations before being overrun in 4071 by goblins, who called their lands the \u201cKingdom of Zog.\u201d A dynasty of seven barghests using the name of Zog held sway until 4217 when the Yellowtongue Sickness ravaged the goblin ranks and they were overthrown by a loose coalition of rivermen, half-elves, and adventurers. Numerous small villages sprang up in fertile valleys, but few towns of consequence, and even those were hardly stable; the largest, the ramshackle pirate haven of Troxell on the Sellen River, burned to the ground in 4328 after a tavern brawl erupted into a full-fledged riot.</p> <p>Lambreth as it now exists arose from the union of three rival merchant families. The Cullertons are Lambreth\u2019s oldest family, founding Maashinelle in 4355 at the confluence of the two rivers, followed by the Angelidis founding Lockridge in 4394, and the Vizcarra founding Sezgin in 4424. Each controlled a tiny city-state, just strong enough that it could not be picked off easily, but small enough to pass beneath the notice of larger neighbors. Yet all three families feared annexation by stronger rivals, especially after the small domain of Dalzell, south of the bend of the Tolemaida, was absorbed by Tymon in 4492. In 4502, after 10 years of delicate negotiations, Leeoda Cullerton proposed a union of the three families, gathering among them all of the isolated villages between the Sellen to the west and the Tolemaida to the east. They would rule as the Triunes of Lambreth, a three-family oligarchy. Still no match for the raw power of Daggermark or Tymon, Lambreth\u2019s wealth and political and trade connections, especially with northern lands farther up the Sellen, granted a modicum of security until the last half-century.</p> <p>In years past, the borders of the River Kingdoms once extended to all the tributaries of the Sellen, with dominions like Prochnau, Marroquin, and Camillus stretching from the Vergan Forest (now called the Exalted Wood) to Ustalav. When Razmir the Living God came to power, however, he was not satisfied with his first annexations but continued to spread his power by word, sword, and flame for over a decade. The establishment of his capital of Thronestep in 4672 was no culmination, but merely a pause while he turned his eyes upon the fragmented dominions that once guarded Lambreth\u2019s riverward flanks. With each lord looking out for his own interests, by the beginning of 4674 those realms had crumbled before bribes, subversion, infiltrative charity, and finally threats, sedition, and outright war, and Razmiran\u2019s iron-masked fanatics held the western bank of the Sellen to the Ustalav frontier.</p> <p>The Triunes\u2019 wealth and influence failed them, as the faceless cultists seemed immune to graft, and infiltrators could make no headway against the ruthless mental conditioning of Razmiran\u2019s acolytes. The other River Kingdoms were marshaling their own defenses against this new threat and had little succor to give, and soon Lambreth was itself being infiltrated by provocateurs from Razmiran, from humble mendicants spreading the word of the generosity of the Living God to poisoners and assassins the equal of any in Daggermark. Hemmed in and desperate, the Triunes were unexpectedly visited by an exiled Andoren knight named Kamdyn Arnefax. Arnefax promised a solution to the Razmiri problem. With some hesitation, the Triunes accepted, even acceding to his outrageous demands (including lordship of Lambreth), assuming he would be killed in a suicidal delaying action that would at least buy time to rally other River Kingdoms to their aid, or\u2014if he did unexpectedly well\u2014could be murdered later. Unfortunately for the Triunes, in their desperation they turned to a man they did not fully understand.</p> <p>Marshaling his own household guards with Lambreth\u2019s piecemeal army and refugees from the fallen kingdoms, Arnefax added not only mercenaries bought with Triune coin but shadow-beasts and hellspawn from the infernal reaches. Astride nightmare steeds and flanked by packs of shadowy hounds, Arnefax and his personal guard, backed by the infamous Catspaw Marauders of Ustalav, launched a devastating sneak attack upon Razmiran\u2019s armies, slaughtering their off icers while his Riverfolk crossed the Sellen by night. The Razmiri camp became a killing field, with precious few escaping the slaughter, and this victory is still celebrated every 26th of Calistril as the Moonlight Massacre of 4675.</p> <p>The elated Triunes prepared a welcome celebration in Maashinelle, but when Master Tandre Cullerton suggested a delay in the recognition of Arnefax\u2019s lordship, the knight coolly snapped the man\u2019s neck with his bare hands. Lady Cullerton swiftly met the same fate when she rushed to her fallen husband\u2019s side. Over their corpses, Arnefax proclaimed: \u201cBetrayal is a crime, and any crime must be punished twice; once for a lesson learned, and once for a lesson remembered. Remember always who rules in Lambreth.\u201d The Angelidis and Vizcarra families both swore fealty at once, while the Cullertons were dispossessed and exiled under penalty of death.</p> <p>Arnefax\u2019s dark legend has grown with passing years, as repeated assassination attempts from Razmiran and rivals within the River Kingdoms have ended only in public torture and execution (often with thornvines grown through the victims and painstakingly crafted into cruel topiary), followed by devastating retaliation by Lord Arnefax and his minions. His most famous punitive act was in 4698 with the burning of three manor houses of merchants and lordlings conspiring against him\u2014all the more remarkable since the manors were in Daggermark, Sevenarches, and Druma, and all were burned in a single night.</p> <p>Justice in Lambreth is harsh even for small-time rustlers and poachers, with two lives forfeit for every beast taken. Arnefax is hardly loved by his people\u2014though he nominally honors the River Freedoms, the \u201cencouragement\u201d of his Black Eagles ensures that most citizens live virtually imprisoned within Lambreth. Still, while Arnefax is prone to bleak moods and his underlings carry a sinister reputation, their eyes rarely fall hard upon the common folk. True, citizens do simply disappear from time to time, but in this dangerous and often lawless region commoners see their lot as perhaps better than most, hoping all the while that dark rumor exaggerates and that, even if true, at least such things will never happen to them. Many commoners actually take a perverse pride in knowing that under Arnefax\u2019s rule tiny Lambreth is not a dominion to be trif led with, by bandit, pirate, merchant, or mad theocrat, a shield that holds masked armies and the encroaching wild at bay.</p>","tags":["Place","River-Kingdom"]},{"location":"Places/River-Kingdoms/Lambreth/#sites","title":"Sites","text":"<p>Maashinelle Lockridge Sezgin</p>","tags":["Place","River-Kingdom"]},{"location":"Places/River-Kingdoms/Mivon-Realm/","title":"Mivon","text":"<p>It was to Mivon (pronounced mih-VON) that many of the Aldori swordlords fled after Choral the Conqueror overthrew the nation of Rostland to create modern day Brevoy.

Though 200 years have passed, the Aldori of Mivon still worry at the memory of their ignominious retreat, and rather than admit the cowardice of their ancestors, have turned the existence of Brevoy itself into an insult to their honor. \u201cCoward\u201d and \u201cBrevoy bird\u201d have become among the gravest insults one can bestow on the Mivoni Aldori, and those who lived here before the exodus have picked it up as well.</p> <p>The land of Mivon is, like all the River Kingdoms, heavily crisscrossed with rivers. Much of the low-lying land is marshy, and the locals have built high and arching stone bridges for their flocks of sheep and herds of cows, who feed on the high hills and in the highlands of the southeast. To the southwest, the kingdom\u2019s borders give way to the Embeth Forest, and in the northeast lives a tribe of exiled elves. The northwest of Mivon shares an uneasy border with Pitax, and though hostilities have largely ended between the two kingdoms, the history between them suggests that the longstanding enmity is never far from the surface.</p> <p>The Aldori exiles have brought their love of dueling to Mivon, and here they have formalized its status: the basis of Mivon\u2019s current society is the List of Suitors, a monthly publication that lists the results of the previous month\u2019s duels. Fortunes rise and fall on the basis of a duel, governmental positions are won or lost, and scores are settled with a quick thrust or lunge.</p> <p>Additionally, the central square of Mivon hosts the Sevier, a weekly gathering for swordsmen and swordswomen who wish to prove themselves in public. They simply appear, present themselves to the judges, and proclaim whom they wish to duel. Duels are usually not held without formal insults, and thus it is customary that a participant in the Sevier studies the list of names, calculates an insult, and delivers it within earshot of at least two witnesses. Many of the Mivoni Aldori have no wish to create everlasting enemies, however, and so must craft an insult that will create a great enough grievance for a response, but not so great that it requires a duel to the death. Attendance among the Aldori is not mandatory; indeed, those who have settled reputations and positions tend to absent themselves from the affair unless they have been specifically challenged to appear.</p> <p>The rules of Mivoni dueling are:  </p> <ul> <li>The challenged picks the weapon and armor </li> <li>The two parties must agree on the victory conditions of the duel; if they cannot, the duel is canceled and both suffer dishonor. Potential conditions include first blood, until one party is disabled, until one party concedes, or until death or otherwise mortal wounding</li> <li>The two parties must agree on the stakes: money, position, a spot on the List, or some other defined object.</li> <li>Anyone between the ages of 16 and 60 may duel. Minors  may not enter the List, no matter how great their skill, and those who achieve seniority may rest upon (or suffer) their reputations thereafter.</li> <li>Both men and women may participate</li> <li>Only Aldori are eligible to win governmental positions.</li> <li>At the Sevier, one may fight only three duels per week, and no duel may last more than 15 minutes.</li> <li>All duels must be witnessed by at least one friend of each participant; otherwise, any fatalities resulting from a duel are considered homicide.</li> <li>A duel's outcome is irrevocable, and shall not be cause for vendetta.</li> </ul> <p>Most Aldori of Brevoy regard Mivoni Aldori as part of a subfaction of the swordpact, and many seek duels with the Mivoni to prove the superiority of their own branch of the tradition. The Mivoni conduct regular duels and face constant incursions from bandits and other fame-seekers drawn from across the River Kingdoms, and so their style has necessarily adjusted itself to become a broader, more encompassing net, a defensive style from which strikes and counters spit like lightning. Swordlords from Brevoy come to Mivon to test their skill and the strength of the Mivoni, and those who return to Brevoy\u2014many of them grievously wounded\u2014report that the Mivoni swordpact flourishes.</p> <p>Non-Aldori winners who achieve some measure of fame in the List may be offered additional Aldori training, provided they have shown interest in the style. Rostlander Aldori may or may not recognize the trainees of Mivoni Aldori as members of the swordpact, depending on whether they wish to insult the bearer of the title.</p> <p>As with most of the River Kingdoms, the early history of Mivon is fragmented, much of it lost to time and the constant eradication of its previous residents. The bandits who cycle through the region ensure that the legends of the land are full of bloodshed, petty and major. The Aldori exiles have shaped the character of this portion of the River Kingdoms, subjugating the more recent inhabitants, who in their turn put down the original settlers to occupy the area.

Decay gnaws away like a cancer in the forest where once a town thrived, where goodwives laughed and sang on the balconies of marble-columned townhouses. Now there is only silence. The hilltop citadel owned by dozens of petty warlords over the last hundred years is humbled and broken by thick boughs; nature dislocates its walls and her roots shatter its back. Yet the silence and stillness conceal strange life and a stirring danger. The land near the citadel is rich in mulberry trees that provide a bountiful harvest for a specialized native creature called a silkgoyle. These creatures resemble insect- like gargoyles, though they lay eggs and their young grow into man-sized silkworm caterpillars before metamorphosing into their adult, gargoyle-like form. Silkgoyles think coldly but no less cruelly than their more familiar kin, and the silk the caterpillars spin is of legendary quality. About a century ago, a group of greedy merchants led by Count Nys subjugated the silkgoyles and established the citadel town of Nystra. Carefully harvesting the silk from the boiled cocoons of the giant larvae, the merchants grew wealthy from their monopoly on the abundant silk.</p> <p>However, the silk merchants were cruel and callous men, prone to playing strange and often depraved games with the hearts and lives of their townsfolk. One such game resulted in the death of the family of Tharl Grimull, a Taldan druid who helped control the larval silkgoyles and was frequently out of town rounding up strays. Rather than throwing away his life in a direct attack on the merchants, Tharl plotted a slow revenge on his employers and all who were willing to stand idly by for the sake of gold.</p> <p>After months of careful cultivation, Tharl developed a strange new breed of plant. He planted its great violet seed in the garden at the center of town, watering it with his tears and blood, and spread the news that on midsummer\u2019s night it would bloom with flowers that would cause the silkgoyle larvae to mature faster, bringing faster prof its to the people of Nystra. Meanwhile, he worked with the few silkgoyles that had managed to avoid being enslaved by the Nystran merchants, stealing larvae belonging to the town and allowing them to turn into adults rather than being boiled alive for their cocoon silk.</p> <p>By midsummer\u2019s day, Tharl\u2019s plant had grown as large as a house, and the townsfolk were eager to see its effects on their captive silkgoyle larvae. As the villagers gathered around the plant, the merchant lords pressed close to witness the event firsthand. At noon, the dozens of violet flowers bloomed simultaneously and released a sweet pollen that entranced all who were near it\u2014giving the blooming, mutated yellow musk creeper plenty of time to bore into their heads and turn them into yellow musk zombies. As the other townsfolk tried to flee, dozens of free silkgoyles (including their metamorphosed, rescued offspring) swarmed the citadel, snatching up villagers and returning them to the violet creeper. None escaped.</p> <p>Now the creeper has overgrown all of Nystra, creating a dark briar of vines and mulberry trees, all festooned with curious violet flowers. The silkgoyles, immune to the powers of the plant, guard their new home, hiding amid the thorns and the ruins of human homes, sometimes idly sifting through the bones and treasures of their former masters. They nurse a terrible hatred for humankind, those who enslaved them and killed their children for silk, and tolerate no trespass. Some who approach Nystra see the flying shapes of the silkgoyles at night and mistake them for demons, and glimpses of man-sized maggots suggest horrors that have escaped from the Worldwound, or perhaps servants of the demon Treerazer of Kyonin. The wise take heed of such disturbing sights and turn back before reaching Nystra proper. Those who ignore the warnings blunder foolishly forward like so many before them, only to fall victim to the beautiful but deadly violet musk creeper.</p> <p>The strangest part of Nystra\u2019s tale is that Tharl was present at the moment of his vengeance and allowed his plant to consume him even as it killed the ones who murdered his family. Somehow, his will lingers on within the briar, steering its growth, animating its vegetation, and sometimes warning the silkgoyles of approaching intruders. Though it lacks intellect or true memory, the creeper still commands some power, and the insectoid rulers of Nystra pay it homage in something akin to worship; in time, Tharl\u2019s creeper may become one of the minor gods of the River Kingdoms\u2014an inhuman thing focused on vengeance, reproduction, and defense of its territory.</p> <p>But the far-off markets of Absalom, Katapesh, and even Tian Xia still covet the rare and beautiful Nystran silk once produced here. Stockpiles of the rich fabric have finally been depleted, textile warehouses sit empty, and it is only a matter of time before foreign trade interests begin sending their own expeditions to Nystra to reclaim the town or capture live silkgoyle larvae to manufacture the legendary silk for themselves.</p>","tags":["Place","River-Kingdom"]},{"location":"Places/River-Kingdoms/Pitax-Realm/","title":"Pitax","text":"<p>Long a haven for thieves and smugglers, Pitax is a hub for trade in the River Kingdoms.

The most famed of these brigands, a rogue with sorcerous powers born with the name Cesare Cattanei but better known as the Silver Fox, took to hiding his band of vicious thieves in a riverside hamlet known as Pitax. As they visited there year after year, the ill-gotten gold of the Silver Fox slowly transformed Pitax into something considerably larger than a simple, sleepy fishing village. Eventually, when the Silver Fox and his followers grew tired of their larcenous ways\u2014and when the prices on their heads in Brevoy became too great\u2014they settled in Pitax permanently, building walls around the village and hiring sellswords to help defend against their enemies. With this, Pitax became a permanent fixture of the River Kingdoms, able to survive and thrive for nearly 4 centuries while others around it withered and decayed.</p> <p>Most of Pitax\u2019s history has been embroiled with strife. The small kingdom constantly battles with its neighbor Mivon-City for control of the fertile territory along the border that they share. Numerian brigands regularly attack the northern reaches of Pitax, and are given covert support by the Numerian crown. Brevoy, though it has never struck at Pitax with its formidable might, always threatens to do so, forcing Pitax to keep a vigilant eye to the east. Small factions within Pitax always squabble with one another for control of the kingdom. The two largest of these factions are the Cattanei and the Liacenza families. The Liacenzas, renowned for their fruit orchards near the town of Sarain, ruled Pitax for the better part of the last century. Though the family\u2019s rule bordered on the thuggish\u2014their dealings with potential rivals tended to be brutal and clumsy\u2014few people within the borders of the small kingdom complained, for they kept the orchards and the vineyards flourishing and gold coins flowing into their coffers from Brevoy and Numeria. Most importantly, they brokered the Grand Tournament of Sarain, which kept the prized vineyards near the village protected from the constant border wars with Mivon-City. Under their guidance, Pitax remained small but secure for decades.</p> <p>This changed in 4702 with the arrival of a Numerian bard named Castruccio Irovetti. With a silver tongue and a sack filled with gold coins, Irovetti bought most of the trading houses in Pitax, and managed to talk his way into profitable partnerships with the rival merchants of the Liacenza family. On one fateful evening, Irovetti invited the leaders of the Liacenza name\u2014the brothers Lothaire and Berengar, warriors renowned for their skills with the rapier\u2014to a card game at one of his warehouses. Somehow, no one present could later recollect the events of that card game, or any part of that strange evening. However, when the sun rose the next morning, Irovetti owned a signed document legally handing over all the possessions of the Liacenza family to him, including the crown of Pitax.</p> <p>Born from the blood and sweat of criminals, Pitax was initially conceived as nothing more than a den of thieves, where bandits could hide from authorities. Though this criminal haven has grown into something far greater, with much influence among the other River Kingdoms and many legitimate businesses driving its economy, its heart remains unchanged. The real goings-on in Pitax take place at night under cover of darkness, where the thieves and bandits who control both the city and the kingdom\u2014a group including the kingdom\u2019s leader\u2014conduct most of their business.</p> <p>Hoping to give Pitax the illusion of respectability, Irovetti formed the Academy of Grand Arts shortly after taking over, hoping to turn the small city into a bastion of fine arts and high culture. Unfortunately, this plan proved to be disastrous. Irovetti insists on carefully controlling whatever the various artists, musicians, actors, and other performers of the academy create or do. As a result, the talented sorts that Irovetti hoped to attract to the academy never come, instead leaving only those with limited talents and great delusions of grandeur to enter its gates.</p>","tags":["Place","River-Kingdom"]},{"location":"Places/River-Kingdoms/Pitax-Realm/#sites","title":"Sites","text":"<p>Pitax Mormouth Sarain Littletown</p>","tags":["Place","River-Kingdom"]},{"location":"Places/River-Kingdoms/Protectorate-of-the-Black-Marquis/","title":"Protectorate of the Black Marquis","text":"<p>This realm is ruled by a single despot guided by the principle of \u201cshared\u201d wealth\u2014shared in that any who wish to do business here must share their wealth with the Black Marquis, paying protection money for the privilege. </p>","tags":["Place","River-Kingdom"]},{"location":"Places/River-Kingdoms/Protectorate-of-the-Black-Marquis/#history","title":"History","text":"<p>In 4700, a Chelish corsair prince named Morgan the White had a dream: he wanted to find a piece of land somewhere adjacent to ship traffic, build a small community of fellow pirates, and extort that ship traffic for every copper he could. His plan had a catch, though\u2014he needed to find a place with water-going traffic that wasn\u2019t already guarded by some enormous empire\u2019s bristling navy. The answer was the River Kingdoms. He gathered every pirate ally he had from the Sodden Lands to the Mandagara League in distant Vudra and convinced them to \u201cretire\u201d to a choice piece of land astride a tributary of the Sellen River in the northern reaches of the River Kingdoms. With these fellow pirates, he created a complicated protection racket known as the Pirate Pact, established through the Marquis Convention (a loose contract of obligations and rules) and crowned himself the White Marquis of an area he called the Protectorate of the White Marquis. For 2 years, Morgan the White\u2019s plan worked flawlessly: hundreds of pirates, scoundrels, thugs, and freebooters arrived from all over Golarion each month, bringing weapons, ships, and their skills, and very quickly the protectorate was boarding a large percentage of the river traffic bound for Numeria and the crusades in Mendev beyond. The White Marquis attended the Outlaw Council in Daggermark during the protectorate\u2019s first year and guaranteed the other leaders of the River Kingdoms that his activities would never directly jeopardize the livelihood of those flying flags of their kingdoms and that they would instead rob outsiders of everything they could. Given that this idea didn\u2019t violate any of the Six River Freedoms\u2014which only apply to Riverfolk\u2014 the Outlaw Council accepted the protectorate into its ranks.</p> <p>In very little time, the ship traffic that regularly traveled the western waterways wised up and began stopping in the pirate capital of Deadbridge on the way north or south to pay a toll. So long as a vessel paid the toll, it continued unmolested across the remaining 30 or so miles through the protectorate\u2019s territory. Those who attempted to sneak past Deadbridge or chose to fight off the protectorate\u2019s protection racket were boarded and slain, their vessels commandeered in the name of the marquis, and their goods sold off into black markets from Tymon to Restov in Brevoy.</p> <p>The success of Morgan the White inevitably led to his downfall as one of his strongest allies, a Vudran maharaja buccaneer, slew the White Marquis in his sleep and usurped power in a bloody coup. Though his name is not remembered, this despot styled himself the Crimson Marquis and led for a brief period before a half-orc ally of the White Marquis named Ultrar Duneshifter (who took power as the Rogue Marquis) jailed him. These events, piled so quickly one on top of the other, destabilized the Pirate Pact, and for several years the region devolved into thievery and chaos.</p> <p>During this time, three different marquises all claimed power and ruled from the three towns of Deadbridge, Farhaven, and Bodie\u2019s Haunt, effectively cutting their branch of the river into three different protection rackets. In 4707, one of the residents of Deadbridge, a porcine man from Numeria named Urdul Bazzak, decided he\u2019d had enough and made a deal with his home nation that if they would send armies south and smash Bodie\u2019s Haunt for him, he\u2019d reduce their prices for all Numerian traffic on the river. The Numerians reluctantly agreed, and while Bazzak sat astride his horse on a nearby hilltop, he watched as the marquis of Bodie\u2019s Haunt was drawn and quartered and the entirety of his community slain. He immediately sent word to the marquises of Farhaven and Deadbridge that the same was about to happen to them, and in a matter of weeks went from a nobody in Deadbridge to the self-styled Black Marquis, the current enforcer of the Pirate Pact.</p> <p>Today the protectorate knows relative peace. It continues to extort river traffic through its territory, and has made deals with Numeria, Mendev, and Brevoy to reduce the likelihood that one of these three nations will crush it out of existence, and holds a loose alliance with the current ruler in Daggermark. There are troubling stories brewing from inside the Echo Wood, though, that giant spiders and other web-spinning creatures are building vermin-infested nests throughout the Azlanti ruins scattered about the wood, but no one has bothered to explore too far away from the river to confirm the accounts.</p> <p>Any who are willing to work for the protectorate may do so, but they must first swear loyalty to the Black Marquis and work for at least 6 months as deckhands on one of the ships before being recognized as full members of the Pirate Pact, with all the wealth-sharing and responsibility that comes with it. Adventurers are frowned upon here, as are crusaders, Pathfinders, and anyone else who might disrupt the way things are.</p>","tags":["Place","River-Kingdom"]},{"location":"Places/River-Kingdoms/Protectorate-of-the-Black-Marquis/#sites","title":"Sites","text":"<p>Deadbridge Farhaven Bodie\u2019s Haunt</p>","tags":["Place","River-Kingdom"]},{"location":"Places/River-Kingdoms/Sevenarches-Realm/","title":"Sevenarches","text":"<p>Before Earthfall, this region was part of the elven empire of Kyonin.

Other races may settle in Sevenarches, but they must obey any order given to them by an Oaksteward or be banished.

The land is fairer, the grass softer, the weather milder, and the sky a brighter blue than only a few yards outside the territory. Sevenarches is possibly the largest River Kingdom in land area, although Gralton and Pitax have decent competing claims to this title. It also has a shocking stability compared to other River Kingdoms, thanks to its sizeable standing army and the hyper-vigilant oversight of the ruling druid sect known as the Oakstewards. Once an elven settlement, and continuously occupied for thousands of years, the territory is now primarily home to fey and the humans who have learned how to live with them</p> <p>Life in Sevenarches is less civilized than in other River Kingdoms. Settlements are small, rough, and fortified. Rather than the loose spreading of a village every few miles that characterizes other civilized settlements in the Inner Sea region, small towns tend to clump together every dozen miles or so, with lightly patrolled farmland in between. Dirt roads with stone mile-markers are the most advanced thoroughfares in the kingdom. Very few roads exist, with those that do primarily running from the city of Sevenarches out to the towns and farms along the rivers. Wild animals, including dire animals, roam freely across most of the realm. Travelers are warned to stay in groups, and hire protection if going very far. The branches and tributaries of the Sellen are the main mode of transit, and most villages and farms are located within a few miles of a riverbank. Civilized Sevenarches strings along the north and east borders of the realm, leaving the interior wild\u2014about 70% of the land is uncultivated, left to the fey and wild creatures.</p> <p>Fey are a notable minority, even living openly among humans in the town of Sevenarches. Though generally helpful, some fey do tend to steal things, replacing them with junk (or sometimes magical items that seem like junk, such as a feather token). Because malicious or troublemaking fey often try to lure people off roads with false pleas and dancing lights, local humans have learned to ignore strangers calling or signaling to humans for help; \u201cStay in sight, all is right,\u201d is a Sevenarches truism.</p> <p>No one in Sevenarches goes hungry, and bandits are noticeably less common here compared to other kingdoms. But the price for stability is paid in liberty. By law, the ruling Oakstewards may demand up to 90% of a person\u2019s holdings without question\u2014whether or not that person is a citizen of Sevenarches. Rebellion brings banishment; armed rebellion is punishable by flaming execution.</p> <p>Oaksteward demands are rarely so drastic\u2014a typical command is to care for a sickened wild animal, to grow a certain kind of plant for a year, or to escort a trespasser to the border. However, in one instance, the Oakstewards demanded the abandonment of an entire village with no explanation, and no assistance in relocation. Over the years, the Oakstewards have become increasingly draconian and unsympathetic in their demands, but the boil is so slow that most residents don\u2019t notice. That said, the Oakstewards are hardly micro- managers. Some Sevenarches residents go years without encountering one. Nevertheless, when one approaches, the druid\u2019s commands must be obeyed.</p> <p>Sevenarches is exceptionally difficult to conquer. The strong fey aspect of the place overwhelms most would-be invaders, as terrain seems to shift, invisible enemies swarm supply lines, weapons are replaced with tree branches, and officers are kidnapped from their campaign tents. A larger power with intent to seize the land could overcome these problems, but a typical River Kingdoms despot with a few hundred soldiers can barely travel a mile without getting lost or turned around. Those who do must then face the wrath of an unknown number of powerful druids on their own territory. Sevenarches remains on civil but distant terms with other kingdoms (although both the civil authorities and the Oakstewards maintain a mutual disdain for Tragshi, the poisoner from Daggermark, who keeps trying to collect rare herbs that grow in the enchanted gardens of Sevenarches). The overbearing mystery of the Oakstewards strains neighbourly relations. However, food policy in Sevenarches covers many sins. Druidic magic ensures that the kingdom of Sevenarches grows abundant crops. They then supply neighbouring kingdoms with surplus grain at reasonable prices, even in famine years, regardless of the buyer\u2019s ideology or morality. This food source allows the southwestern end of the River Kingdoms to survive through harsh political shifts, and endears the Oakstewards to commoners who live near Sevenarches territory, no matter what their lords may think.</p>","tags":["Place","River-Kingdom"]},{"location":"Places/River-Kingdoms/Sevenarches-Realm/#sites","title":"Sites","text":"<p>Sevenarches Seven Arches The Den Elderwoods Thinlands Wilewood</p>","tags":["Place","River-Kingdom"]},{"location":"Places/River-Kingdoms/Stolen-Lands/","title":"Stolen Lands","text":"<p>This large swath of land along the northeastern border serves as a buffer between Brevoy and the River Kingdoms\u2014traditionally the haunt of bandits and monstrous humanoids, the Stolen Lands are regarded as \u201cstolen\u201d by all nations along its border, even though none have ever been able to keep these realms under their control for long. \u00a0</p>","tags":["Place","River-Kingdom"]},{"location":"Places/River-Kingdoms/Stolen-Lands/#history","title":"History","text":"<p>Across the northern frontier of the River Kingdoms runs a hinterland not even the most brazen [[Stag-Lord-Bandits|bandit lords]] dare to claim.

Experts in horological devices perform potentially world-changing experiments, while skilled woodsmen guide wayward travelers and clash with vengeful fey. The land is a vibrant tangle of nature, scattered with vagabonds and criminals interested in remaining hidden, and opportunistic alchemists running secret labs seeking profit from the rare plants found in the marshy lowlands of the Embeth Forest.</p> <p>While no major parts of the Sellen River flow through the Embeth Forest, creeks and tributaries weave through the region. The entire forest rests in a low-lying area dotted with stagnant marshes and rising knolls. The land here does not lend itself well to travel or farming of any sort, but the dense wood allows for a hidden refuge. Filled with spiteful sprites and hungry beasts, the region is avoided by most travelers.</p> <p>Nestled firmly in the River Kingdoms and surrounded on all sides by other principalities such as Mivon, Gralton, and Pitax, Uringen sees few raids from its neighbors. Likewise, bordering nations like Numeria and Galt never push far enough into the River Kingdoms with aims of conquest. Many see nothing worth taking in the wood\u2014a situation well suited to the citizens of Uringen. Not concerned with grabbing for power, Uringen is content to remain hidden and protect their trade secrets. An ingrained sense of self-defense and the desire to keep out of sight and untouched has created some of the best guerrilla fighters in the region.</p> <p>The Ulfen skald Birji Uringen settled in the River Kingdoms after a long career of adventuring. Infamous for never keeping his ego in check, Birji named the settlement after himself. Shortly after arriving, he and his wizard companion Rhona Ambros (the better mind of the two) began construction of a complex clock tower, bringing in a number of settlers from his home to the far northwest as well as settlers from Ambros\u2019s birthplace in Ustalav. This mix in the original population led to a blending of languages, and many people in the kingdom speak a dialect of Skald cobbled together with Common. The clock tower is a massive device built following instructions in a stolen manuscript on time alteration magic. Due to improper assembly, curious tinkering, or arcane power surges from the ancient fey circle beneath its foundations, the device malfunctioned when first activated and brought the tower and its immediate surroundings into a pocket dimension partially outside of time, lodged between Golarion and the First World. This temporally unstuck area encompasses the central third of the town, including the large public square south of the clock tower. While most of the tower holds complex precision machinery, shelves line nearly every available wall, holding painstakingly recorded notes of every tick and whir of the device.</p> <p>In addition to the town\u2019s mysterious condition, Uringen makes itself difficult to find, so that it never seems to be exactly where it is supposed to be. The woodsmen of Embeth Forest (see The Embeth Camps), despite their refusal to enter the town, remain the most reliable source of directions to Uringen. The quiet nomads act as guides for people seeking the town, managing to eke out a basic living with the bartered proceeds from this service.</p> <p>The citizens of Uringen lead quiet lives. Most keep to their tasks, working the alchemical labs or providing services for those who do. Inhabitants of the static portion of town lead a relatively normal existence, though they are always on the lookout for harassment by fey. The town is orderly and people leave each other to their business. Those dwelling in the static side of town rarely do business in the unstuck portion for fear of being whisked away. When they do venture in, they make their visits short. Residents of unstuck Uringen behave more casually, welcoming their haphazard life. While hard work constructing curatives and alchemical goods goes on in this side of town, the taverns are typically filled with gregarious patrons who carry on in a festive manner. Only the most adventurous travelers choose to spend the night in unstuck Uringen\u2019s inns, and it is common knowledge that over the years many visitors have disappeared overnight while the central part of town was out of phase with the rest of Golarion. In recent years, the kingdom has gained a reputation for powerful potions. Whether obtained from the town itself or strange travellers in the wood, the region\u2019s concoctions give rise to few complaints concerning their reliability or cost. In addition to the natural protection lent by geography, Uringen supplies Daggermark with local ingredients for poisons, a partnership contributing to their relative safety. While the two parts of Uringen produce very similar goods, a marked demand for unstuck Uringen potions and salves exists, as buyers feel those products perform better.</p> <p>In particular demand is a plant called nightmoss, which grows in towering cypress trees throughout the Embeth Forest. A handful of Uringen residents know the secret formulas to brew the moss into powerful potions aimed at strengthening the body and healing physical conditions.</p> <p>Nightmoss, if prepared and distilled properly, replicates the effects of a potion of cure light wounds, while other variants aimed at restoring sight and purging diseases reportedly exist.</p>","tags":["Place","River-Kingdom"]},{"location":"Places/River-Kingdoms/Uringen-Realm/#sites","title":"Sites","text":"<p>Uringen Embeth Camps Nightmoss Camp Spry's Heart</p>","tags":["Place","River-Kingdom"]},{"location":"Places/Settlements/Artume-City/","title":"Artume","text":"<p>Plagued by assassinations and treachery, Artume is a kingdom without a king.

The spacious hall had been meticulously arranged for a splendid feast, guarded by vigilant heavily armed soldiers. A roaring fire emanated warmth from a colossal fireplace, its iron lever secured by a lock, adding to the hall's decor. Ornate chandeliers adorned the ceiling, casting a soft glow over the exquisite artwork gracing the walls. Tables at the room's center were laden with silverware, surrounded by the aroma of roasted meats and other delectable dishes.</p> <p>Seated amongst us were two companions: Amiri, a formidable Kellid Barbarian, and Tartuccio, a witty gnome wizard. As conversation flowed, Amiri voiced her anticipation for Lady Jamandi's presence, while Tartuccio couldn't resist continued snide jabs at Amiri's perceived lack of manners, eyeing us to see if we'd agree. Meanwhile, Lizzy indulged in a drink from the pitcher, adding to the lively atmosphere of the gathering.</p> <p>As Ioseph Sellemius and the graceful Lady Jamandi Aldori entered the hall, an air of importance accompanied them. Lady Jamandi, with her striking half-elven beauty, commanded attention as she joined the gathering. Ioseph took the opportunity to introduce her, elaborating on her significance and the pressing need for adventurers in their endeavors, in name of the Aldori Swordlords.</p> <p>Lady Aldori spoke of the perilous nature of the Stolen Lands - a realm plagued by monsters and bandits, its rulership constantly in flux. Undeterred by the challenges, she extended an invitation for bold souls to claim these lands, promising recognition from Rostland for those who succeeded. With a determined gesture, she raised her gauntlet, symbolizing her resolve.</p> <p>Amidst the preparations for the feast, conversations veered towards various topics. Kairos delved into the intricate politics of Brevoy, while Djames recounted legends surrounding the Aldori lineage, emphasizing the Aldori wealth and prowess. Djames also shared insights into Lady Aldori's background specifically, detailing her history as a mercenary and how she has now retired to her mansion, focused on her status and estate.</p> <p>Lizzy approached Linzi with curiosity, remarking on her petite stature in her typically candid manner. Engaging in what could be considered polite conversation by Lizzy's standards, she inquired about Linzi's musical talents and instruments. Linzi, eager to share, began weaving a captivating tale of heroism and adventure through her music.</p> <p>However, as Linzi's story grew lengthy, Kairos interjected, shifting the conversation towards the bard's attire, a clear indicator of her profession. This redirection led to a discussion about Pitax, its political landscape, and the challenges faced by artists under its rule.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Lizzy's playful antics with her gold bead and Gomi, her trusty companion, left a lasting impression on Linzi. The bard was charmed by Lizzy's demeanor and delighted in the attention given to her beloved pet. Before long, Gomi was receiving affectionate pets from Linzi, further cementing the bond between the two groups.</p> <p>Leonardo's attempt at flirtation with Valerie fell flat, met with polite but distant responses from her. Despite this, Valerie eagerly engaged in political discourse, displaying a keen interest in such matters. She recognized Leonardo from their shared circles in Brevoy's noble society, leading to a discussion about their backgrounds and connections.</p> <p>Turning his attention to Harrim, Leonardo adopted a more imposing demeanor. Harrim, a dwarf with a weathered appearance, spoke openly about his pursuit of death during their conversation. As a cleric of Groetus, he viewed death as an inevitable part of existence, discussing its significance and implications for prophecy. Despite Leonardo's jest about hastening Harrim's demise, the dwarf remained steadfast in his beliefs, emphasizing the acceptance of mortality.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Djames conversed with Maegar Varn, focusing on local politics. Djames observed the crest adorning Varn's attire, recognizing it as the emblem of House Varn. Inquiring about its significance, Maegar revealed his familial ties to the house, although his interest in the conversation waned over time, indicating a lack of enthusiasm for further discussion.</p> <p>After encountering a lukewarm reception from Maegar Varn, Djames redirected his attention to Linzi, who greeted him warmly, citing Lizzy's praise of him. Djames shared a tale of nature's resilience and the bonds the party has already forged, offering insights into his philosophy on settling the Stolen Lands. Intrigued, Linzi inquired about his favorite performers, revealing her admiration for a performer group called \"The Walking Tears\". Djames reciprocated with his preference for the performer group \"Securius\", captivating Linzi with their shared love for storytelling. As a gesture of appreciation, Linzi presented Djames with a Jade Cat and an Onyx Panther as parting gifts.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Kairos attempted to engage Jaethal in conversation, noting her aloof demeanor. Despite Kairos's efforts, Jaethal remained focused on her food, signalling a lack of interest. Similarly, Kairos's interaction with Harrim centered on polite conversation, with Kairos unable to decipher the religious symbolism adorning Harrim's attire.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Lizzy struck up a conversation with Amiri, admiring her appearance and learning about the origins of her sword and the losses suffered by her clan. As their discussion turned to drinking and revelry, Lizzy, Amiri, and Djames bonded over shared experiences, quickly forming a camaraderie as drinking buddies. However, Lizzy's tolerance for alcohol appeared limited, evident in her slightly impaired state.</p> <p>Kairos engaged Valerie in conversation, probing into her motivations for joining the expedition. However, Valerie remained guarded, offering only vague sentiments about seeking a fresh start, opting to keep the discussion at a superficial level.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Djames recognized the Iron Wraiths, an adventuring party clad in full plate armor even during festivities. Notably, he also identified Hannis Drelev among the attendees, adding an air of familiarity to the gathering.</p> <p>As the evening progressed, Lizzy's inebriation became more apparent, leading her to ramble to Amiri as tiny liquor bubbles seemingly emanated from her. Sensing Lizzy's increasing intoxication, Djames intervened while Kairos questioned Amiri about her knowledge of the Broken Tusk tribes, to which Amiri admitted unfamiliarity. Leonardo, curious about Amiri's sword, conversed with her in Hallit, while Lizzy continued to distribute alcohol to the party. Grateful for the lively stories shared, Amiri expressed her appreciation by offering Lizzy a +1 Dagger.</p> <p>Meanwhile, outside, the storm intensified, its relentless downpour punctuated by the tolling of a bell. Lady Jamandi seized the moment to address the gathering, encouraging everyone to enjoy the food and drink before retiring early. With cheers from the revelers echoing through the hall, Lady Jamandi hinted at forthcoming discussions regarding each adventuring party's specific missions and directives in the Stolen Lands.</p>","tags":["Session"]},{"location":"Playing-Notes/Session-0/#summary","title":"Summary","text":"<ul> <li>met Lady Jamandi Aldori: The host of the gathering, a half-elf noblewoman who extends the invitation for adventurers to claim the Stolen Lands.</li> <li>met Ioseph Sellemius: A companion of Lady Jamandi, who helps introduce her and explains the purpose of the gathering.</li> <li>met Amiri: A Kellid Barbarian </li> <li>met Tartuccio: A gnome wizard</li> <li>met Valerie: A Brevoy noble adventurer</li> <li>met Harrim: A dwarf cleric of Groetus</li> <li>met Linzi: A bard who interacts with Lizzy, Djames, and Kairos, exchanging stories and gifts.</li> <li>met Jaethal: A pale and sober elf </li> <li>met Hannis Drelev: A Brevoy noble, and an old acquaintance of Leonardo</li> <li>Linzi gifted Djames with a Jade Cat and an Onyx Panther as parting gifts.</li> <li>Amiri offered Lizzy a +1 Dagger as a token of gratitude.</li> </ul>","tags":["Session"]},{"location":"Playing-Notes/Session-0/#25-calistril-4710","title":"25 Calistril 4710","text":"<p>We retired to our quarters around 9 in the evening, seeking sleep, though Lizzy, true to her nature, remained in more of a plant-like hibernation. However, our slumber was abruptly interrupted at 3 in the morning by a hounding cry echoing through the halls. Despite the disturbance, Djames remained sound asleep until Lizzy roused him from his slumber. Quickly realizing the urgency of the situation, we sprang into action, hastily donning our armor while Lizzy directed Gomi to cautiously scout the corridors.</p> <p>Gomi's reconnaissance revealed the presence of dark figures lurking nearby. Acting swiftly, Kairos pressed herself against the wall, blending into the shadows as she cautiously opened the door. Sensing imminent danger, the party prepared to ambush the attackers, bracing for the impending confrontation.</p> <p>As the assailants breached the threshold, Lizzy unleashed a volley from her sling, narrowly missing her target. Simultaneously, a second attacker targeted Leonardo with a ranged assault before retreating to reload. Seizing the opportunity, Kairos emerged from the doorway, wielding her Elven Glaive with deadly precision in a spellstrike. Meanwhile, Djames employed his magic, casting Daze to incapacitate the second assailant.</p> <p>With the situation escalating, Lizzy commanded Gomi to unleash a powerful Electric Arc attack, incapacitating both the second guard and a third attacker. In the chaos that ensued, Leonardo delivered a decisive blow, dispatching the final assailant and neutralizing the immediate threat.</p> <p>As the sounds of conflict echoed through the castle corridors, a heavy thud reverberated, signaling the closure of the gates and the implementation of a lockdown. Lizzy approached the fallen guard in an attempt to assess his condition, but it was clear he had succumbed to his injuries. Meanwhile, Leonardo wasted no time in preparing himself, donning his cumbersome armor in anticipation of further confrontations.</p> <p>With a cautious approach, we divided into smaller groups to investigate different rooms, searching for any surviving occupants. Kairos's initial inspection revealed a room devoid of life but marked by blood-soaked bedding and a grim discovery of a severed hand. In another room, Lizzy, accompanied by Gomi and Djames, stumbled upon several corpses alongside a gleaming object, while a separate chamber yielded a minor healing potion, promptly claimed by Kairos.</p> <p>Despite the absence of inhabitants in the final room Kairos inspected, the disheveled bedding hinted at recent occupation. Conversely, the chamber examined by Lizzy, Gomi, and Djames revealed a similarly desolate scene, with bloodstained beds serving as the only remnants of previous occupants. With Leonardo now fully armored, we proceeded to the indoor gardens, where we were met by four hostile assailants lying in wait.</p> <p>Kairos wasted no time in engaging the attackers, swiftly dispatching the first with a decisive blow. However, her subsequent attempt was met with less success as the second attacker narrowly evaded her strike, opting instead to target Lizzy with a ranged assault, fortunately missing its mark.</p> <p>After the skirmish intensified, Lizzy swiftly conjured a protective barrier using her Interposing Earth ability, seeking cover from the assailants' onslaught. In a display of formidable prowess, Leonardo, fueled by bloodlust, advanced towards a third attacker, delivering a devastating blow with his greatsword that sent the assailant reeling.</p> <p>Undeterred, the remaining adversaries pressed their assault. One assailant hurled a mysterious bottle of white liquid at Lizzy's barricade, striking both her and Djames, while another fired a crossbow at Gomi. In response, Lizzy unleashed her Wilding Word, directed at the assailant who targeted Gomi, while Djames rallied the party with a resounding Courageous Anthem before incapacitating the second assailant with his Daze spell.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Kairos tapped into her arcane abilities, unleashing a Dimensional Assault attack that swiftly dispatched the final enemy. As a precaution, she fortified herself with a Shield cantrip. Despite the enemy's futile attempts to retaliate with crossbow fire, Kairos remained unscathed, save for a minor splash damage, while Leonardo swiftly dispatched the last foe in a decisive counterattack.</p> <p>While exploring the area, Djames's keen eye catches sight of an intriguing statue. Crafted from marble, it depicts a life-sized half-elf woman wielding a rose and a shield. Despite Djames and Kairos being unable to identify its significance, Lizzy notices a small door concealed beneath the statue's base. Wasting no time, Djames unlocks the door with a bronze key, revealing a cache of valuable items: - 4 Minor healing potions - Barkskin potion - Lesser potion of fire resistance</p> <p>Kairos goes back to loot the corpses of the enemies, and to find the silver ring left out earlier. She also finds a longsword, which she gives to Leonardo. </p> <p>When the party continues, a deep and dull roar sounds through the rooms. Gomi checks the room where the sound came from, and flies back when Gomi knows it has seen a monster. There's a small person in the room, someone who Gomi knows has recently pet Gomi. We carefully check inside and see a giant.</p> <p>Leonardo and Kairos ready Runic Weapon, and Kairos enters Arcane Cascade. Djames is up first, and uses Courageous Anthem to inspire all party members. He then casts Forbidden Ward om Djames and the giant inside. Kairos ran inside, and used a Spellstrike attack with her Runic Weapon spell and Gouging Claw. The ogre is clearly blinded and starts scratching himself furiously, and Gomi finishes the giant with an attack. </p> <p>We take an Ogre-hook and his lice invested furs. Linzi is glad about being rescued and hands a Scroll of Inkshot to Gomi and Lizzy. Lizzy also guides us into a secret room with a trunk, where Djames hands us bronze key and the party opens it. The trunk contains 8 bags with 100 gold each, a +1 mace, a+1 longsword, 2 lesser healing potions, and a small leatherbound journal.</p> <p>We also explore some of the servents quarters, and what is clearly a storeroom, but move on as soon as we can. We soon enter a mesh hall with a battered and beaten giant, which Lizzy immediately recognizes as a Frost Giant, after Amiri's description. We contemplate his wounds, and Lizzy slowly approaches him to cast an AoE Heal spell on him and heals his wounds. </p> <p>We hear some soft moans as the Heal spell takes effect, and immediately Lizzy notices Harrim, Valerie, and Amiri. Lizzy talks with the Frost Giant and convinces it to let us pass in a friendly manner. They ask about the Frost Giant, and Lizzy argues it's a big friend now. Kairos remembers everything about Frost Giants, including how hostile and evil they can be. Even though the giant isn't attacking, there's a lot of hostile air, and Amiri and Valerie in particular consider attacking the giant. </p> <p>Kairos argues that we can't break a certain deal, as it would violate the second River Freedom. Lizzy tries a last attempt at letting us pass, and convinces the giant to let us pass and leave the castle. Valerie isn't happy, but accepts our answer, while Amiri is extremely mad about our choice.</p> <p>Pressing forward, we thoroughly search the remaining rooms, uncovering a trove of gold, weapons, armor, and a Tanglefoot Bag. After calming Amiri's anger, we proceed to the great hall, prepared to continue our journey.</p>","tags":["Session"]},{"location":"Playing-Notes/Session-0/#summary_1","title":"Summary","text":"<ul> <li>Fought a group of assassins</li> <li>Fought another group of assassins</li> <li>Fought a Frost Giant and saved Linzi</li> <li>Negotiated with another Frost Giant to leave Aldori Manor</li> <li>Linzi gave Gomi and Lizzy a Scroll of Inkshot.</li> <li>Djames discovered multiple potions and a bronze key under a statue, including:<ul> <li>4 Minor healing potions</li> <li>Barkskin potion</li> <li>Lesser potion of fire resistance</li> </ul> </li> <li>Kairos found a longsword and a silver ring.</li> <li>Lizzy received a +1 mace and a +1 longsword from a trunk discovered by Djames, as well as 2 lesser healing potions and a small leather-bound journal found in the same trunk.</li> <li>Found various armors and weapons in different chambers</li> <li>Kairos found a Tanglefoot Bag</li> <li>Found 800 gold intended as wages for the Aldori Manor guards</li> </ul>","tags":["Session"]},{"location":"Playing-Notes/Session-1/","title":"Session 1","text":""},{"location":"Playing-Notes/Session-1/#25-calistril-4710","title":"25 Calistril 4710","text":"<p>The scene in the great hall is one of chaos and destruction, with tables turned into barricades and blood staining the floor. Guards stand vigilant, and the atmosphere is tense as the party recounts their encounter with assassins and frost giants. They explain their actions to a guard who immediately starts questioning them but eventually understands their predicament. After some persuasion, the guard introduces himself as Ivenzi. He is a tall man with grey eyes, short black hair, prominent eyebrows, and a short mustache.</p> <p>Ivenzi informs the party of the situation: mercenaries and various types of giants have infiltrated the manor, forcing all guards to gather in the grand hall while Lady Jamandi Aldori leads the effort to clear the rest of the building. Some attackers have fled into the west wing, while others went in the east wing where the party came from. Smoke billows from underneath closed doors, indicating fires raging behind.</p> <p>Djames fashions some primitive yet effective gas masks, to mitigate the effects of the smoke. The masks consisted of pieces of cloth soaked in water, which would then be tied around the faces of the wearers to act as a barrier against the smoke inhalation. </p> <p>Lizzy uses a Slashing Gust to clear the rest of the smoke. When Lizzy uses her Slashing Gust spell, her appearance changes in a remarkable way. Her limbs elongate and multiply, resembling a myriad of branches and tendrils. These new appendages sway and twist with a bizarre grace, almost as if they possess a life of their own. With each wave and motion, the branches and limbs generate powerful gusts of wind, slicing through the air with a sharp and cutting force. Leaves and debris whirl around her as the wind intensifies, creating a whirlwind effect that helps to disperse the smoke and clear the air. Meanwhile, Djames would scan the hallway for flammable objects, but sensed they had already been removed from this hallway. </p> <p>As the smoke began to dissipate, revealing a hall seemingly free of flames, our attention turned to the bedrooms adjacent to the corridor. Recognizing the potential danger for any survivors within, we resolved to investigate each room, closing off those engulfed in fire to contain the smoke.</p> <p>Leonardo took charge of examining the first room, while Djames and Lizzy ventured into the second, leaving Kairos to explore a third chamber on her own. Most of the doors of the rooms had already burned away, and the room Kairos went into didn't seem to be on fire at all, being an open room connected to the hallway.</p> <p>Inside the open room, Kairos encountered a solemn scene - a polished floor marred by smoke stains and an armored statue depicting a half-elf woman. This statue represented Milani the Everbloom, a deity revered by those who championed the oppressed. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Leonardo's investigation led him to a chamber already ravaged by fire, offering little hope of finding survivors.</p> <p>In the largest bedroom, Djames and Lizzy faced a sudden onslaught as they opened the door\u2014a rush of flames surged into the hallway. Lizzy, undeterred, continued to manipulate her branches, attempting to stave off the advancing blaze. With quick thinking, Djames tossed a waterskin to Lizzy and assessed the situation\u2014the beds ablaze, the door smoldering. Acting swiftly, Djames utilized the water from the skin to douse the flames, preventing further escalation of the inferno.</p> <p>As Djames passed the waterskin to Leonardo, each member of the party sprang into action to combat the encroaching flames. Kairos, entering a fourth room, valiantly fought against the fire, but soon found herself inside a searing heat. Lizzy, wielding her branches like a makeshift extinguisher, joined the effort, managing to quell some of the flames within the room.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Djames began channeling tales of heroism to bolster Kairos' resolve. Amidst the recitation, Kairos couldn't help but be puzzled by the embellished accounts of her past woven into Djames's narrative, but was inspired by the grand epic that Djames appeared to be making up on the spot.</p> <p>As Leonardo approached the group, he bestowed his guidance upon Kairos, empowering her efforts. Determined, Kairos seized her waterskin, pouring its contents onto the fire until it was depleted. Despite her valiant efforts, the flames continued to rage, and in her attempt to stamp them out, Kairos suffered burns of her own.</p> <p>As Lizzy continued to fan the flames, Djames's inspiring words spurred Kairos on, although she remained puzzled by the bard's knowledge of her past. Leonardo, utilizing his prestidigitation, managed to cool down the fire, allowing Kairos to stomp out the remaining flames in her room.</p> <p>With determination, Lizzy proceeded to the final room, using her branches to combat the fire, albeit with some minor burns. Leonardo swiftly extinguished the flames in the fourth room, rendering it safe. Kairos, undeterred by her previous injuries, attempted to extinguish the fires in the last room but struggled to make significant progress, sustaining further burns in the process. Fortunately, Djames's protective magic shielded Kairos from harm as he continued his inspiring narrative.</p> <p>Leonardo employs his Prestidigitation magic to snuff out the lingering flames in the final room. Together, Djames, Leonardo, and Kairos make their way into the shrine of Milani, taking a moment to recenter themselves and offer prayers to the gods. Kairos directs her prayers to Pharasma, while Leonardo and Djames pay homage to Milani, seeking guidance and protection in their endeavor.</p> <p>As Lizzy ventures into the next hall, her eyes fall upon the unconscious figure of Tartuccio, sprawled on the ground as if attempting to flee one of the bedrooms. With a gentle touch of her branches, Lizzy manages to stabilize him, coaxing him back to consciousness. However, the gratitude quickly dissipates as Tartuccio's abrasive nature resurfaces, demanding to be escorted back to the great hall.</p> <p>Despite his sharp words, Lizzy offers her support, aiding him as they make their way through the corridors. Inadvertently, a misstep causes Lizzy's branches to brush against Tartuccio, eliciting a sharp reaction from him. In his frustration, Tartuccio lashes out at Lizzy, further upsetting her. Overwhelmed by the confrontation, Lizzy finds herself succumbing to tears, the emotional strain of the situation taking its toll.</p> <p>As the rest of the party concludes their moment of meditation, they emerge from the shrine to find Tartuccio storming through the halls, his demeanor still as confrontational as ever. Lizzy remains in the hallway, tears staining her cheeks, as Tartuccio's presence only adds to the tension.</p> <p>In a display of defiance, Tartuccio addresses the party, dubbing them his \"little helpers\" and demanding their assistance. Leonardo, unwilling to entertain his demands, sternly instructs him to be silent, while Djames launches into an impassioned tirade extolling the virtues of House Lebeda.</p> <p>Unfazed by the threats, Tartuccio continues on his way, prompting Leonardo and Kairos to step forward. Leonardo attempts to impede his progress, while Kairos plays a mischievous prank on Tartuccio with magic by casting Telekinetic Hand to throw his robe over his eyes.</p> <p>As the party moves forward, they come across Lizzy, still visibly upset and crying in one of the rooms. Leonardo, showing compassion, approaches her and attempts to offer comfort. He gently wipes away a single large bubble of green snot from Lizzy's nostrils before helping her to her feet, offering his support in this trying moment.</p> <p>From here, we find ourselves in a cross-roads between two rooms. Leonardo bursts into the first room, a lavishly decorated space featuring a pool table, only to find Jaethal tied to one of the plush chairs. Frustrated and alarmed, Leonardo demands an explanation, but a loud voice interrupts him, claiming to be busy. Gomi, floating above Leonardo's head, adds to the chaos. Undeterred, Leonardo rallies the party to stand together for House Lebeda's honor. Inside the room, three assailants await.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Kairos steps into a second room cluttered with weapon and armor racks, most of them empty or in disarray. Hearing commotion from the neighboring room, Kairos swiftly returns to assist. She immediately engages one of the assailants with a spellstrike, dealing lethal blows that ultimately lead to the assailant's demise. However, another attacker turns their attention to Leonardo, launching a swift assault that catches him off guard, leaving him temporarily vulnerable.</p> <p>Djames continues to lament on the successes of House Lebeda to inspire Leonardo, as he casts Daze on one of the assailants to blast them with a mental shock. Meanwhile, Leonardo retaliates against the attacker who initially struck him, bolstered by Djames' courageous words. With a powerful swing, Leonardo strikes at the assailant, but unfortunately misses his mark after crossing the room.</p> <p>Gomi joins the fray, unleashing an Electric Arc attack that the assailant narrowly evades, still taking some damage from the residual shock. Kairos, employing Arcane Cascade and utilizing Time Sense to enhance her precision, delivers a precise strike with her Elven Fauchard. Djames contributes by attempting to demoralize the assailant further.</p> <p>Working together, the party subdues the Black Tears bandit, inflicting non-lethal damage and securing them with manacles and a gag to prevent further resistance.</p> <p>After freeing Jaethal from her restraints, the party attempts to heal her using Lizzy's natural abilities, but unfortunately, there is no response. Concerned, Lizzy notes the absence of a heartbeat from Jaethal, indicating something unusual about her condition.</p> <p>Jaethal inquires about the fire situation, and upon learning that the halls are now safe, she agrees to return to the great hall. Lizzy makes another observation about Jaethal's lack of heartbeat, prompting the party to urge Jaethal to accompany them back to the main hall, along with the captured prisoner.</p> <p>In the next room, the party discovers polished white tiles adorning the floor, along with an array of trophy heads mounted on the walls. Among the trophies are heads of a stag, an owl, a wolf, and various reptilian monsters. While exploring, Kairos uncovers a Bloodseeker Beak Talisman, a valuable find amidst the trophies. Lizzy, intrigued by the collection of dead animals, thoroughly examines them but doesn't find anything noteworthy.</p> <p>As the party cautiously approaches the next room, they hear noises emanating from within. Lizzy decides to send in Gomi to scout the area, carefully opening the door just enough for the familiar to slip through. With bated breath, Lizzy observes through Gomi's eyes as they spot two Frost Giants engaged in battle. Kairos and Leonardo prepare their Runic Weapon spells, as they get ready to join in on the fray.</p> <p>Inside the dueling arena, Lady Jamandi Aldori is locked in combat with the towering Frost Giants, her skills tested against their immense strength. Without hesitation, Kairos and Leonardo rush in to join the fray, ready to lend their aid to their noble leader.</p> <p>The arena is vast, its walls padded and adorned with various weapons and armors, providing ample cover for the intense battle unfolding within. Despite the formidable foes already present, the arrival of new assailants through an adjoining door signals that the danger is far from over, prompting the party to brace themselves for yet another round of combat. </p> <p>As the chaos unfolds in the dueling arena, amidst the clash of swords and the roar of giants, Lady Jamandi Aldori's commanding voice cuts through the tumult, directing the party's attention to a formidable figure among the assailants. Clad in black chainmail and wielding a massive battle-axe with deadly precision, this woman stands out as the leader of the Black Tears, a group notorious for their nefarious deeds. We would later find out her name is Volodmyra, and she is the leader of the attackers, a group called the Black Tears.</p> <p>As the battle unfolds in the dueling arena, Lizzy takes the initiative by unleashing a crackling Electric Arc, targeting two of the attackers with bolts of lightning. Meanwhile, Djames employs a Command spell, compelling one of the Frost Giants to relinquish its weapon, momentarily disrupting its offensive capabilities.</p> <p>Responding swiftly to the chaos, Lady Jamandi Aldori demonstrates her formidable prowess by severing the arm of a Frost Giant with a decisive blow from her weapon. Leonardo charges into the fray with his greatsword, effortlessly dispatching an assailant in a single powerful strike.</p> <p>Kairos joins the melee, erecting a protective Shield spell around herself before unleashing a cascade of arcane energy, surrounded herself by shimmering runes that glow with otherworldly power. Djames employs another Command spell to instil fear in an assailant, compelling it to flee from the battle, and continues to support his allies, Djames by unleashing another another inspiring anthem, rallying Leonardo with words of courage as the battle rages on in the dueling arena.</p> <p>With steely determination, Leonardo unleashes a fearsome display of intimidation, causing one of the bandits to falter in fear before swiftly dispatching him with a lethal blow from his weapon. In a fluid motion, he pivots to engage another assailant, delivering a devastating strike that swiftly ends their threat.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Kairos taps into the arcane energies swirling around her, teleporting through the runes adorning her body to unleash a Spellstrike of unparalleled power. As her strikes connect, it seems as though claws from different timelines converge, guided by the glowing runes, culminating in a devastating critical hit that leaves a significant impact on their foe. Lizzy finishes the assailant off. </p> <p>Upon searching the body of Volodmyra, the party discovers several valuable items: 1. Trackers Goggles 2. +1 Greataxe 3. Chainmail 4. 4 lesser healing potions 5. 5 minor healing potions 6. A jade and pearl necklace (worth 20 gp) 7. A silver ring (worth 30 gp)</p> <p>The party decides to divide the potions they found among themselves. This ensures that each member of the party has a basic supply of healing potions to use as needed during their adventures in the Stolen Lands.</p> <p>As the party takes a moment to catch their breath and survey their surroundings, they are drawn to a magnificent window that offers a breathtaking view of Northern Brevoy. The first light of dawn begins to peek over the horizon, casting a warm glow over the city of Restov. With the sun's gentle ascent, the city gradually comes to life, its buildings and streets bathed in the soft morning light. It's a serene and peaceful sight, a moment of tranquility amidst the chaos and turmoil they've faced.</p> <p>After wrapping up her affairs, Lady Jamandi Aldori extends her gratitude to the party for their steadfast defense of the manor. In a reciprocal gesture, the party returns the safeguarded guard wages to Lady Aldori, reinforcing their commitment to aiding and protecting the interests of House Aldori and the stability of the region.</p> <p>Lady Jamandi Aldori generously distributes rewards to each member of the party as a token of appreciation for their valorous efforts in safeguarding the manor. Each member receives two lesser healing potions to aid in their future endeavors, along with a sum of 50 gold coins, further recognizing their contributions and dedication to the cause.</p> <p>Gathering in the great hall after several hours, we witness the impressive efficiency of the manor's staff in restoring order and tidying up the aftermath of the attack. Lady Jamandi addresses the assembled survivors, her resolve unwavering despite the recent turmoil. She emphasizes that this attack will not deter her from her mission and the vision she holds for the future.</p> <p>As a gesture of her unwavering resolve, Jamandi Aldori stresses that it's time to send four different groups into the Stolen Lands. </p> <ul> <li>Iron Wraiths: Tasked with operating in the Glenebon Uplands, their mission involves defeating the Tiger Lords, a formidable adversary, and establishing diplomatic relations with Pitax, a crucial diplomatic endeavor.</li> <li>Baron Hannis Drelev: Given the responsibility of securing the Hooktongue Slough region, Baron Drelev's mission focuses on establishing control over the eastern Sellen River, a strategic waterway vital for trade and defense.</li> <li>Maegar Varn: Stationed in the Nomen Heights, Maegar Varn oversees the development of a town fortified by a Varnling host. Additionally, his mission involves establishing an alliance with the centaurs and overseeing the operations of an Aldori dueling school, aiming to foster martial prowess and unity.</li> <li>Lebeda Expedition: Tasked with exploring and pacifying the Greenbelt and Narlmarches regions, the Lebeda Expedition aims to establish a presence in these untamed wilderness areas, paving the way for future settlement and expansion under the banner of House Lebeda.</li> </ul> <p>Jamandi Aldori recommends that the party begin their endeavors at a trading post that has been severely affected by Stag Lord's Bandits activity. This suggests that restoring order and security to this trading post would not only serve as a crucial first step in stabilizing the region but also demonstrate the party's capability in dealing with threats to commerce and safety, laying the groundwork for further expansion and development.</p> <p>Now that Aldori Manor is safe, we catch a few hours more sleep. In the morning, Kairos heads into Restov to sell different parts of bandit loot. Djames and Lizzy also head into Restov; Djames with the intention of purchasing new high-fashion clothing, while Lizzy places orders for a new dress and robes. Additionally, Djames sends a coded letter to Lander Lebeda, using secret phrases to hint at their clandestine connection.</p> <p>Kairos also invests in a donkey pack mule to assist with transportation and carrying supplies on their upcoming ventures.</p>"},{"location":"Playing-Notes/Session-1/#summary","title":"Summary","text":"<ul> <li>Met Ivenzi</li> <li>Extinguished flames</li> <li>Rescued Tartuccio</li> <li>Rescued Jaethal</li> <li>Helped Jamandi Aldori defeat Frost Giants and the Black Tears</li> <li>Returned soldier wages and received a reward from Jamandi Aldori</li> <li>Kairos found a Bloodseeker Beak Talisman</li> <li>We found some treasure, with a 50gp value</li> <li>Sold loot, bought donkey</li> <li>Each party member found 1 lesser healing potion and 1 minor healing potion.

We also mark the Rostland Hinterlands, of which Oleg's Trading Post is a part. Our initial travels towards Oleg's Trading Post will take us past Nivakta's Crossing, and the Crooked Falls. </p> <p>With advance notice from Jamandi Aldori, Oleg's Trading Post was prepared for the party's arrival. Accompanied by the traders, we journeyed downstream along the Shrike River. After three days of travel, we finally arrived at Oleg's Trading Post, where Oleg Leveton, his wife Svetlana Leveton, and the other inhabitants were expecting our arrival.</p> <p>Upon our arrival at Oleg's Trading Post, we are warmly welcomed by Svetlana Leveton, who invites us inside, mentioning that stew and bread are already cooking on the stove. As we settle down outside near the fire, we hear the sound of hammering coming from the roof of the trading post. Oleg pauses his work and descends from the trading post to join us.</p> <p>Oleg welcomes us with a brusque tone, inquiring if we're here to assist with the [[Stag-Lord-Bandits|Stag Lord's Bandit]] situation. Kairos attempts a jest about being here to help against the [[Stag-Lord-Bandits|Stag Lord's Bandits]], which Oleg doesn't find amusing. Djames quickly offers an apology on behalf of the group. Both Djames and Kairos then proceed to explain our mission, clarifying that we've been dispatched by Jamandi Aldori.</p> <p>Djames reiterates our intention to bring civilization to the Stolen Lands, a sentiment that OIeg appears to dismiss. Kairos chimes in, highlighting the potential increase in trade such civilization might bring to Oleg. However, Oleg remains unimpressed, emphasizing his immediate need for assistance against the [[Stag-Lord-Bandits|Stag Lord's Bandits]] demanding \"taxes\". Despite Lizzy's offer to aid in repairing the housing, Oleg doesn't seem swayed by our goodwill gestures. Oleg emphasizes that he relocated to a remote and quiet area of Rostland precisely for the tranquility and solitude it offers.</p> <p>Kairos inquires about Oleg's bandit problem, prompting Oleg to explain that the [[Stag-Lord-Bandits|Stag Lord's Bandits]] typically arrive once a month, consistently on the first day of the month, precisely at the crack of dawn. When Leonardo probes for further details regarding the size and armament of the bandit groups, Oleg reveals that initially, they arrived with a few dozen individuals, but over time, their numbers have dwindled with each subsequent visit.</p> <p>To fortify the trading post, the group decides on a strategic plan. They opt to dig Spike Traps around the perimeter, which will be triggered by Lizzy's Timber cantrip. Djames and Oleg will collaborate to create distractions or obstacles to hinder the bandits before they launch their attack. Additionally, they plan to strategically position the carts to funnel the bandits towards the spike traps. Furthermore, they intend to prepare a kettle of hot sand above the entrance to the trading post as a secondary trap that can be deployed against any reinforcements. This strategy aimed to maximize the trading post's defenses and repel the [[Stag-Lord-Bandits|Stag Lord's Bandit]] threat effectively.</p> <p>We also asked Oleg and Svetlana to remain as far back into the safest room of Oleg's Trading Post as they could, but both refused. Though Oleg agreed that his wife should be kept safe, he thought it'd be suspicious to the [[Stag-Lord-Bandits|Stag Lord's Bandits]] if he and Svetlana weren't present. </p>"},{"location":"Playing-Notes/Session-1/#summary_1","title":"Summary","text":"<ul> <li>Took three days to travel to Olegs Trading Post</li> <li>Met Oleg Leveton and Svetlana Leveton</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Playing-Notes/Session-1/#1-pharast-4710","title":"1 Pharast 4710","text":"<p>The group dedicates the entire day to constructing the traps, and when the Stag Lord's Bandits finally arrive, the traps prove to be more effective than anticipated.

Happs Bydon reveals that they are aligned with a woman named Kressle, who he warns will soon retaliate against them.</p> <p>As the interrogation intensifies, Happs becomes increasingly agitated, defying the group's threats and demanding to know the strength of their army.

Under pressure, Happs revealed that they were located near Tuskwater Lake and at the edge of the Greenbelt, specifically at the Thorn River Camp. Meanwhile, Lizzy took a less friendly approach, trying to extract information by shoving branches under his fingernails.</p> <p>Oleg, the owner of Oleg's Trading Post, offered us free lodging and meals, as well as the [[Stag-Lord-Bandits|Stag Lord's Bandit]]' gear. He declared his trading post could serve as our home base. We placed Happs inside a deep hole in the ground and asked Oleg to provide him with just enough food to subsist.</p> <p>We purchased a simple map from Oleg for one gold piece. Oleg also mentioned that his trading post could supply most items that are easily available from Restov, but that he'd need time and money to fullfil more complex requests, and had significant difficulty acquiring rare items.</p> <p><code>Oleg's Trading Post is rated at level 3, and can supply any common items up to level 3, needs time to procure uncommon items, and has difficulty acquiring rare items.</code></p> <p>Knowing that each hex on the map represented 12 miles, and that we travelled at 2.5 miles per hour, we calculated that we could cover about two hexes per day. Leonardo doffed his armor before we set off. We left Oleg's Trading Post around noon.</p> <p>After four hours of travel, we stumbled upon a large graveyard filled with animal carcasses. Lizzy identified them as victims of a Brush Thylacine, a smaller nocturnal marsupial carnivore with a harsh reputation as a bogeyman. Though they usually hunted alone, the presence of multiple carcasses suggested a pack.</p> <p>Soon, we encountered two thylacines. Kairos initiated the fight with a powerful spellstrike, inflicting a bleeding wound. The creature tried to retaliate, but luckily to little effect. Leonardo quickly joined the fray, attacking the first thylacine, only to be targeted by the second. Undeterred, Leonardo fought bravely. Lizzy, attempting to gain a vantage point, tried and failed to climb a rock three times in rapid succession.</p> <p>Kairos entered an Arcane Cascade, recharged her spellstrike, and moved strategically. The first thylacine attacked Leonardo again before succumbing to its wound from Kairos' spellstrike. Leonardo then turned his attention to the second thylacine. Lizzy finally managed to climb the rock as the second thylacine attempted to flee, but Kairos struck it down with another powerful spellstrike.</p> <p>After the battle, Lizzy tended to Leonardo's wounds while we set up camp. Lizzy foraged for food and cooked, Leonardo entertained us with a campfire story, and Kairos organized the watch schedule. By 18:00, we had finished our preparations. Lizzy's cooking was hearty and filling. Leonardo and Kairos tried to camouflage the camp, though not very effectively, finishing around 20:00.</p> <p><code>+1 bonus to saving throws from Lizzy's cooking</code></p> <p>Gomi took the first watch while Lizzy relaxed. Kairos used Light and Time Sense to make the camp a little bit homelier. We spent some time maintaining Kairos's clockwork and Leonardo's android body, and Kairos also spent time with Clowy.</p> <p>In the middle of the night, Gomi flew over us to warn of two boars approaching our camp. The first boar charged at Kairos's tent after Lizzy attacked it, then fled. Kairos responded with a Dimensional Assault, tumbling through space to strike back. Leonardo engaged the boar near his tent.</p> <p>The boars then targeted Lizzy, who fought back from atop a rock while the boars attacked the base. Kairos used a spellstrike to attack the boar near her, allowing Leonardo to finish it off. Lizzy attempted an Inkshot but missed. Kairos moved closer, recharged her spellstrike, and cast Shield on herself. The remaining boar charged around a giant rock to attack Kairos but missed. Leonardo then moved in to attack, and Lizzy used Electric Arc to finish off the boar.</p> <p>After the battle, Kairos' tent was toast, so she needed some time to set it up again.

Djames mentioned that back at Oleg's Trading Post, he had sent letters to the Iron Wraiths, Hannis Drelev, and Maegar Varn to inquire about their expeditions. </p> <p>Lizzy used her Predict Weather spell; the weather was mild with no significant effects. She and Djames set out to track the herd of boars that had attacked us during the night, leaving signals for Leonardo and Kairos to follow later. The pair had no trouble tracking the herd and also discovered human tracks leading deeper into the woods. Djames kept up an encouraging performance to boost Lizzy's spirits, and she continued tracking the humans.</p> <p>Lizzy deduced that the human tracks were likely from the [[Stag-Lord-Bandits|Stag Lord's Bandit]] camp of Kressle, one of the lackeys of the Stag Lord and the boss of Happs. Meanwhile, Leonardo and Kairos prepared the boar meat by slicing and smoking it with prestidigitation. After about two hours of preparation, we packed up the camp and easily found the signals left by Lizzy and Djames.</p> <p>While waiting for Kairos and Leonardo, Lizzy attempted to locate the [[Stag-Lord-Bandits|Stag Lord's Bandit]] camp, hiding while instructing Gomi to spy on the bandits. Gomi observed several bandits chopping wood, conversing, and occasionally scanning the area. There was a lookout higher up on a platform, where he had a good overview of the area. The [[Stag-Lord-Bandits|Stag Lord's Bandits]] mentioned \"little pests\" stealing shipments intended for the Stag Lord.</p> <p>We devised a plan to attack the camp from multiple directions. Kairos would target a bandit on a higher platform, Lizzy would circle around to cast Sleep, and Leonardo would hide nearby. Djames would approach directly and attempt to distract them with diplomacy.</p> <p>Djames requested a friendly audience, but the [[Stag-Lord-Bandits|Stag Lord's Bandits]] were initially hostile. The situation shifted when Djames lied about being a wine trader named \"Fred van der Meer.\" The bandits' demeanor changed, and they invited Djames to join them and discuss wines.</p> <p>Seizing the moment, Lizzy cast Sleep, causing the leader Kressle and one of her lackeys to fall asleep. Another lackey bolted, and Kairos climbed up to eliminate the lookout. As the fleeing bandit triggered a muffled alarm further up the river, Djames maintained his ruse. Kairos swiftly killed the lookout with a Spellstrike, while Leonardo intercepted and killed the fleeing bandit with an Athletic Rush.</p> <p>Lizzy advanced towards the source of the alarm, running openly. Djames, pretending to be one of the bandits, yelled for help. Kairos descended, recharged her spellstrike, and moved close to the sleeping bandits. Leonardo's Divine Lance nearly killed one bandit, and Djames used a Daze spell to knock him out. </p> <p>Lizzy and Djames capture the final lookout on the final bandit. They try to take the captured [[Stag-Lord-Bandits|Stag Lord's Bandit]] down from the platform - Djames casts Guidance while also using his courageous anthem, but it doesn't seem to particularly inspire Lizzy. Despite that, they take down the bandit safely.</p> <p>Kressle does wake up from being tied up, but to no avail. While she struggles, Kairos whips her and asks her to be good. Kairos asks her how loyal she is to the Stag Lord. Kressle responds that she's unbelievably loyal to Stag Lord. Lizzy immediately threatens to make branches grow inside her face to intimidate Kressle. Unsurprisingly, Kressle is intimidated. Kressle tells us that the Stag Lord is hiding in the Tuskwater Lake encampment, and is much stronger than we are.</p> <p>The other bandits are a little bit more open to interrogation. We ask them the following questions:</p> <p>Who\u2019s your boss? \u201cOur boss is a monster of a man. Calls himself the Stag Lord. He\u2019s a deadeye with the bow, and I saw him crush a prisoner\u2019s hand to mush in one fist. Come to think of it, I\u2019ve never seen him without his creepy stag helmet on\u2014some say he ain\u2019t got no face under it, but not me\u2014I think that creepy helm is his face!\u201d</p> <p>How many bandits work for your boss?  \u201cIt\u2019s hard keeping track of who\u2019s working for the boss, so we use a master phrase as a sort of password to get into the fort on the northeast shore of the Tuskwater Lake.\u201d What\u2019s the password? \u201cUnless it\u2019s been changed recently, the current phrase is, \u2018By the bloody bones of Saint Gilmorg, who wants to know?\u2019 And no, I have no idea who \u2018Saint Gilmorg\u2019 is.\u201d</p> <p>What\u2019s with all the booze? What is the Stag Lord like? \u201cThe Stag Lord is a bloody drunk. All that booze under the platform is for him. He\u2019s half of what he used to be, and he ain\u2019t never been right in the head. I hear he punched a horse for spittin\u2019 in the yard a few weeks ago. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t care if he dropped dead tomorrow, but even drunk out of his mind, he\u2019s still got a fair amount of fight to him.\u201d</p> <p>Who\u2019s the Stag Lord\u2019s boss? Are there any other bosses? \u201cThe Stag Lord keeps a strange old man locked up in the basement. I suspect the old guy might actually be running the show, using the Stag Lord as a puppet, you know. I got a look into the old guy\u2019s eyes once, and it terrified me. He ain\u2019t someone I\u2019d want to cross.\u201d</p> <p>Where's Svetlana's Ring? \u201cA couple of bags of loot were stolen a while back by a group of filthy gremlins\u2014the annoying little pests live under the old sycamore tree to the east. We were lucky that what they snatched was mostly just copper and some cheap-looking trinkets, otherwise the Stag Lord would have our skins for sure! That ring we took from the trader woman was in there, though, I\u2019m sure of it.\u201d</p> <p>Will you help us fight the Stag Lord? The bandits fear the Stag Lord, and if this topic comes up, they blanch and shake their heads in fear.</p> <p>Finally, from the bandits, we loot the following: - 4 daggers  - 4 leather armor - 1 studded leather armor - 2 hatchets - 4 short bows - 5 silver stag lord amulets (worth 3 gp each) - 8 days of rations - lesser healing potion - 36 gold, 126 silver - a pair of silver earrings worth 15 gp - a wooden music box worth 8 gp - three crates of furs and pelts worth 5 gp per crate - 8 bottles of herbal liquor, each worth 2 gp. - mundane supplies, like food, firewood, and tents - a load of liquor - 1 lesser thunderstone</p> <p>Kairos fixed the chart so we can take back the [[Stag-Lord-Bandits|Stag Lord's Bandits]]. Inside the chart are all components to make a spike snare. We also take all liquor inside the chart. It turns out the bandits kept all the local treasure inside of the chart. We use the chart and Rucio to haul everything back to Oleg's Trading Post. Early on during our travels, we are ambushed by tree spiders. We prepare for the attack; Djames reacts with a Courageous Anthem with a Lingerous Composition. </p> <p><code>+1 on damage rolls, attack rolls, and against fear effects</code></p> <p>As our encounter with the spiders began, Djames attempted to cast a Command spell, but it had no effect on the creatures. Leonardo swiftly drew his weapon, which began to glow as he cast Runic Weapon. Meanwhile, Kairos approached one of the spiders, drew her weapon, and delivered a quick reaching strike that, unfortunately, didn't do much damage.</p> <p>The spider retaliated by leaping down to bite Kairos before retreating back into the tree. Lizzy then cast Slashing Gust on both spiders, causing the first one to drop dead from the tree. The second spider, injured from the attack, retaliated with a web attack.</p> <p>Djames responded with a Daze spell and shouted at the spider to demoralize it. Although the spider didn't understand the words, it was thoroughly intimidated. Djames then finished it off with a Divine Lance attack.</p> <p>After the battle, we harvested the spiders, obtaining two special ingredients and two vials of hunting spider venom.</p> <ul> <li>2 Special Ingredients</li> <li>2 Vials of Hunting Spider venom</li> </ul> <p>We travel back to Oleg.

Leonardo yells back that we're open to trading. One of the kobolds refuses to bargain and throws dirt at us. </p> <p>We interpret this as a call to initiate combat to scare them off. Djames begins his courageous anthem, inspiring all of us. He then throws a Daze on one of the more aggressive kobolds. </p> <p>Lizzy uses Slashing Gust to attack 2 of the kobolds. One of the kobolds, the most aggressive one closest to us, dies from the attack. Leonardo moves in to cast an Electric Arc attack. Another one of the kobolds dies, a third kobold with a purple hat taking another fair brunt of the attack. </p> <p>Kairos tumbles through time and space to attack with her whip, for nonlethal damage. She knocks out a fourth goblin. The final fifth kobolds tries to chug multiple spears at Kairos, but doesn't hit. Lizzy walks forward, then throws a Needle Darts spell, but also doesn't succeed. </p> <p>Kairos switches to her bolas and throws them at him. Kairos then casts Shield. The kobold tries to attack back with a sling, and hits Kairos in the face. Djames ends the encounter by casting Daze again.</p> <p>Lizzy checks the 2 dead kobolds for loot.  - 4 leather armor - 4 slings - 4 spears - 2 basic ingredients from Moon Radishes  - Moon Radishes for Svetlana </p> <p>We seek to make a camp. Lizzy finds a good camp. Djames tells an inspiring campfire story and organizes a watch. Lizzy tries to scavenge for ingredients, then cook. Lizzy makes Fish-on-a-stick.</p> <p><code>+1 status bonus to Perception</code> <code>For the next 24 hours, the eater can go for up to 17 hours without sleep before becoming fatigued.</code></p>","tags":["Session"]},{"location":"Playing-Notes/Session-3/#summary_1","title":"Summary","text":"<ul> <li>Liberation of the Moon Radish Patch.
